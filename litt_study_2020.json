The experiment shows that this robot can track a signal wire well which is set on the ground for navigation, and it obtains a nice steering ability even for short turns with the speed less than 0.5 m/s. Although the productivity of the prototype is not quite efficient, the robot still meets the requirements of pesticide spraying in the greenhouse without human operators.",

For vehicles operating at low speeds on hard, flat surfaces, kinematic models utilizing the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of the tracks or wheels of a skid-steer vehicle have been shown to provide accurate motion and power use estimation. Previous work has relied on post-process optimization to learn necessary ICR location and terrain information for motion and power modeling. The work presented here utilizes an extended Kalman filter for learning ICR locations and the recursive least squares algorithm for learning terrain-related power model parameters. The algorithms have been implemented on a wheeled skid-steer vehicle, and field test results show good estimation of motion and power usage using no prior terrain information and only knowledge of vehicle geometry and mass distribution, intermittent GPS and heading, and odometry information from the slipping tires/treads.",

Such a controller considers, for the first time in literature, the dynamics associated with the three subsystems that compose a WMR, i.e., mechanical structure, actuators, and power stage. The high level corresponds to an input-output linearization control for the mechanical structure; the medium level is based on two sensorless controls designed via differential flatness for the actuators; and the low level is related to two cascade controls based on sliding modes and PI control for the power stage. The performance and robustness of the controller is verified and shown via realistic simulations when parametric uncertainties associated with the subsystems that compose the WMR are considered.",

Recently, anthropomorphic LEE solutions have gained wide spread interest to remedy the interference issues encountered at the human-robot interface. In that context, this paper presents a multi-degrees of freedom modular power-assist LEE robot with compatible joint axes to enhance kinematic compliance. The proposed LEE, named Anthro-X, supports all three DoF at the hip joint using a novel articulated mechanism. The polycentric motion of the knee joint is also facilitated using a unique mechanism based on four-bar linkage system. In total, Anthro-X has five DoF per limb where sagittal plane motions of hip and knee joints are powered by external power supply and others are passively supported. The prototype of the proposed LEE robot was fitted on a male subject to verify the kinematic conformity of hip and knee joint mechanisms. Experiments were then conducted to evaluate the effects of providing power assistance using Anthro-X during squatting exercises. Results indicate that the proposed design can be readily adapted for wide range of applications requiring motion or power assistance owing to its modular and anthropomorphic architecture.",

Methods A consecutive cohort of 436 rectal cancer patients who underwent curative RA SSOs were prospectively enrolled during 2010–2014, including 123 patients with ICG imaging (ICG+ group) and 313 patients without ICG imaging (ICG– group). Results ICG imaging appeared to be helpful in identifying competent perfusion of the bowel adjacent to the anastomosis in 13 patients (10.6%) who might be susceptible to bowel ischaemia, including restrictive mesocolon. AL was remarkably greater in the ICG– group compared with the ICG+ group (5.4% vs 0.8%; p = 0.031). Conclusions ICG imaging during RA SSO provides accurate real-time knowledge of the perfusion status at or near the anastomosis, specifically reducing AL in patients who may incur bowel ischaemia.

		"abstract": "Background. Bilateral arm training (BAT) has shown promise in expediting progress toward upper limb recovery in chronic stroke patients, but its neural correlates are poorly understood. Objective. To evaluate changes in upper limb function and EEG power after a robot-assisted BAT in chronic stroke patients. Methods. In a within-subject design, seven right-handed chronic stroke patients with upper limb paresis received 21 sessions (3 days/week) of the robot-assisted BAT. The outcomes were changes in score on the upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM), Motricity Index (MI), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) evaluated at the baseline (T0), posttraining (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2). Event-related desynchronization/synchronization were calculated in the upper alpha and the beta frequency ranges. Results. Significant improvement in all outcomes was measured over the course of the study. Changes in FM were significant at T2, and in MAS at T1 and T2. After training, desynchronization on the ipsilesional sensorimotor areas increased during passive and active movement, as compared with T0. Conclusions. A repetitive robotic-assisted BAT program may improve upper limb motor function and reduce spasticity in the chronically impaired paretic arm. Effects on spasticity were associated with EEG changes over the ipsilesional sensorimotor network.",

		"abstract": "To improve the energy efficiency of the Mecanum wheel, this article extends the dynamic window approach by adding a new energy-related criterion for minimizing the power consumption of autonomous mobile robots. The energy consumption of the Mecanum robot is first modeled by considering major factors. Then, the model is utilized in the extended dynamic window approach–based local trajectory planner to additionally evaluate the omnidirectional velocities of the robot. Based on the new trajectory planning objective that minimizes power consumption, energy-reduction autonomous navigation is proposed via the combinational cost objectives of low power consumption and high speed. Comprehensive experiments are performed in various autonomous navigation task scenarios, to validate the energy consumption model and to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in minimizing the power consumption and reducing the energy consumption. It is observed that the technique effectively takes advantage of the Mecanum robot’s redundant maneuverability, can cope with any type of path and is able to fulfil online obstacle avoidance.",

However, root cause of reduced heaviness and factors affecting the heaviness are still unclear though the knowledge on the root cause/factors could be used to modulate human's feelings and the interactions between human and robot. This paper investigated the causes/factors behind the reduced heaviness. We adopted two strategies for this. Firstly, we included weight perception in robot dynamics (and control) in such a way that the mass parameter of the inertial force was considered different from that of the gravitational force because the perceived weight is different from the actual weight. Secondly, we compared weight perception, load forces and motions for power-assisted manipulation to that for manual manipulation and identified some clues regarding the causes/factors of reduced heaviness. We found that perceived weight, load force and its rate, velocity and acceleration for power-assisted objects were lower than that for manually lifted objects. We observed time delays in position sensing, force sensing, servomotor etc. for the power-assisted objects, however, the delays were almost absent for the manually lifted objects. We argued that the delays were the root cause of reduced heaviness and the elements of the system contributing to the delays were the factors affecting the perceived heaviness. To cross-check it, we increased time constant of the servomotor and found that the increased time constant reduced perceived weight. The findings may be used to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that may help improve/modulate interactions between robots and users.",

The active balancing method is applied by super-capacitor switching scheme. Since super capacitor's power density and life cycle performance are better than a high power battery, it can transfer energy between cells without redundant overheads. The complementary characteristics analysis between the super-capacitor and lithium battery is introduced, and the simulation of this power system reveals a good effect under pulse-load robot. The super-capacitor applied not only absorbed massive surging power to lighten burden of the lithium battery but also balanced cells through switching. A control board with super-capacitor is realized for practical installing on robot. The simulation and experimental results has shown this method can be realized in practical environment with multiple applications.",

The model is used for detailed design of the kinematic and actuator parameters and for the synthesis of a controller. An incorrect model results in poor performance or unstable operation of the robots. A jumping robot is generally modeled by switching systems for before and after jumping, and a precise model is necessary to perform effective jumping. This paper analyzes two dynamic modeling methods for a jumping robot via the energy conversion principle. The robot uses a compliant link to jump by storing kinetic energy as potential energy in elastic deflection. Linear and torsion-based dynamic models were developed, and the torsion-based model uses a pseudo-rigid-body model. The modeling results were verified by simulation and experiment, and the results shows that the simple linear model is more suitable for estimating the movement. The model can be used to determine the optimal design parameters for effective and energy-efficient jumping.",

The sensor carried by the robot is capable of detecting the remaining thickness of the zinc layer over the steel wires that make the core of the aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) commonly used in power lines. The sensor is made of a contactless coil that encircles the conductor and applies an alternating longitudinal magnetic field along the conductor. This field induces eddy currents in the zinc layer that changes the coil impedance, which is used to obtain the zinc layer thickness.

		"abstract": "The rise in energy consumption and the associated costs instigate financial concerns among industrial energy consumers. For industrial processes addressing heating and cooling as well as material transformation, a wide range of energy efficiency measures have been developed and successfully implemented. In contrast to that, most robot-based operations such as pick-and-place motions or assembly tasks still use inefficient standard concepts causing high-energy consumption and high-energy costs. Thanks to a rather low payload-to-weight ratio of new robot designs, such as parallel kinematic or hybrid robot manipulators, a high potential for energy savings is expected. This article identifies potentials for energy saving concerning industrial consumers by assessing three different robot concepts. Based on a literature review, two existing designs for robots – the conventional serial robot and the parallel kinematic robot are analysed and compared with respect to the energy utilised during a typical item placement task. Afterwards, the concept of PARAGRIP, a hybrid of the two presented robot designs is introduced and examined based on simulation regarding its energy consumption. The final results demonstrate significantly different energy consumptions between the robot concepts, identifying potential savings of about 40% in a selected industrial application scenario.",

		"abstract": "A variable stiffness actuator is inspired by the human motor control and is the most popular actuator used to exploit the human performance and human-like motion. However, these actuators are typically highly non-linear and redundant not only in their kinematics but also in their dynamics due to their capability to modulate their stiffness and positions simultaneously. It is not trivial to generate the trajectory for a strongly non-linear and redundant dynamic system equipped with variable stiffness actuators. In this paper, a trajectory planning method for a variable stiffness actuated robot via a time-energy optimal control policy is proposed. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the trajectory planning method through the case studies of a two degree of freedom variable stiffness actuated robot. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed method could be able to generate the motion which is similar to the human arm motion strategy.",

		"abstract": "The robotics industry is growing rapidly, and to a large extent the development of this market sector is due to the area of social robotics – the production of robots that are designed to enter the space of human social interaction, both physically and semantically. Since social robots present a new type of social agent, they have been aptly classified as a disruptive technology, i.e. the sort of technology which affects the core of our current social practices and might lead to profound cultural and social change. Due to its disruptive and innovative potential, social robotics raises not only questions about utility, ethics, and legal aspects, but calls for “robo-philosophy” – the comprehensive philosophical reflection from the perspectives of all philosophical disciplines. This book presents the proceedings of the first conference in this new area, “Robo-Philosophy 2014 – Sociable Robots and the Future of Social Relations, held in Aarhus, Denmark, in August 2014. The short papers and abstracts collected here address questions of social robotics from the perspectives of philosophy of mind, social ontology, ethics, meta-ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, intercultural philosophy, and metaphilosophy. Social robotics is still in its early stages, but it is precisely now that we need to reflect its possible cultural repercussions. This book is accessible to a wide readership and will be of interest to everyone involved in the development and use of social robotics applications, from social roboticists to policy makers.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents an approach to predict energy consumption in mobility systems for wheeled ground robots. The energy autonomy is a critical problem for various battery-powered systems. Specifically, the consumption prediction in mobility systems, which is difficult to obtain due to its complex interactivity, can be used to improve energy efficiency. To address this problem, a self-supervised approach is presented which considers terrain geometry and soil types. Especially, this paper analyzes soil types which affect energy usage models, then proposes a prediction scheme based on terrain type recognition and simple consumption modeling. The developed vibration-based terrain classifier is validated with a field test in diverse volcanic terrain.",

		"abstract": "This paper examines an integrated path planning and power management problem for a solar-powered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The proposed method seeks to minimize the travel time of the UGV through an area of known energy density by designing a smooth, heuristically optimized path and allocating the vehicle's power among its electrical components, while the UGV harvests ambient energy along the designed path to satisfy with the mission's strict energy constraints. A scalar field is first established to evaluate the solar radiation density at discrete locations. A modified particle swarm optimization method is applied to search for a minimal time path wherein the energy gathered is equal to or greater than the energy expended. The proposed modeling and optimization strategy is verified through computer simulation and experimental demonstration.",

First, a rigid multi-body dynamic model of the robot and a flexible multi-body dynamic model of a span of transmission line were built with Lagrange equation and modal synthesis method, respectively. Then the two models were coupled in the grasping point under two typical postures of passing obstacles. The dynamic response simulation of each posture was carried out with three different spans of flexible overhead transmission line. The laws governing impacts of flexible job environment upon the robot's dynamic response performance are explored through simulation results comparison and analysis.",

		"abstract": "Active power-assist exoskeletons are becoming more prospective than follow-up types, especially for elderly and handicapped motion auxiliary. The exoskeleton is required not only to withstand load but also to actively share the weight of a human body. Active power-assist lower limb is designed to meet this expectation. The definition of “active power-assist” was suggested in this article. A unique man–machine motion mapping was derived based on the configuration matching, wherein the exoskeleton obtains the wearer’s motion data and parse out the corresponding intention. Man–machine coupling mechanisms were exquisitely configured, which rationalize the degrees of freedom of the man–machine system and facilitate force transmission for active assistant. The dynamic knees and hip joints with the integrated force servo unit were designed, which is the key to realize soft contact and cooperative movement. The prototype was developed, and three basic functions (human movement perception, force transmission, and movement cooperation) were preliminarily verified in a single leg swinging experiment. The effect of follow-up mode and active power-assist mode were quantitatively analyzed in marches-on-the-spot experiment. A 24.6% proportional reduction of the wearer foot force and smooth man–machine coordination in field experiments has demonstrated the feasibility of this structure design of active power-assist lower limb.",

A meta-analysis was conducted with the RevMan 5.3 software.\nEvidence synthesis\nSix comparative studies were identified. Overall, 369 cases were included for the analysis (171 NIRF-RAPN and 198 standard RAPN). No significant difference was identified between groups in baseline characteristics, operating time, and estimated blood loss; however, a shorter clamping time was recorded for the NIRF-RAPN group. Functional outcomes revealed higher overall estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in the NIRF-RAPN group at short-term (1–3 mo) postoperative follow-up (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 9.26ml/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.46, 12.06; p<0.001). In two studies, a renal scan-based assessment of split eGFR was available, and pooled analysis revealed higher split eGFR for NIRF-RAPN (WMD: 7.91ml/min; 95% CI: 4.26, 11.56; p < 0.001), and lower Δ % between preoperative and 1-mo eGFR (WMD: −7.84%; 95% CI: −8.85, −6.83; p<0.00001).\nConclusions\nCurrent evidence regarding the use of NIRF-guided selective clamping during RAPN is based on a limited number of studies from high-volume institutions. Notwithstanding these limitations, NIRF-RAPN can be safely performed, and it might offer better short-term renal functional outcomes. It remains to be determined whether this can ultimately translate into a clinical benefit for patients undergoing RAPN, especially in the long term.\nPatient summary\nWe assessed the outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) performed with or without the use of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. NIRF-RAPN appeared to be a safe procedure with potential better short-term functional outcomes.",

With the analysis of obstacle-navigation control process, a localization method and database is introduced. When inspection robot surmounts the obstacles, two laser sensors are adopted for checking two marginal points on OGWs, and the pose of OGWs is determined by the checking marginal points. According to the kinematics model of inspection robot, the motion can be programmed by the algorithm proposed, and the arm can realizes autonomously to be on OGWs reliably after searching and wheel-line alignment process. This paper presents database with hybrid architecture and analyzes decision-making of obstacle-navigation in layered planning mode. Experiment results show that the control strategy can guide the inspection robot to patrol along the transmission lines and cross obstacles efficiently.",

		"abstract": "The coordination of cyclic multi-robot systems is a critical issue to avoid collisions but also to obtain the shortest cycle-time. This paper presents a novel methodology for trajectory and coordination optimisation of cyclic multi-robot systems. Both velocity tuning and time delays are used to coordinate the robots that operate in close proximity and avoid collisions. The novel element is the non-linear programming optimisation model that directly co-adjusts the multi-robot coordination during the trajectory optimisation, which allows optimising these as one problem. The methodology is demonstrated for productivity/smoothness optimisation, and for energy efficiency optimisation. An experimental validation is done for a real-world case study that considers the multi-robot material handling system of a multi-stage tandem press line. The results show that the productivity optimisation with the methodology is competitive compared to previous research and that substantial improvements can be achieved, e.g. up to 50% smoother trajectories and 14% reduction in energy consumption for the same productivity. This paper addresses the current lack of systematic methodologies for generating optimal coordinated trajectories for cyclic multi-robot systems to improve the productivity, smoothness, and energy efficiency.",

		"abstract": "Moball is a wind-driven spherical robot equipped with sensors for in-situ observation of scientifically important and windy environments, e.g., the Earth's polar regions, Mars, and Saturn's moon Titan. More importantly, Moball incorporates an internal triaxial set of linear electromagnetic generators which can be used to harvest wind energy for long-duration self-sustained operation, or to bias its' wind-driven motions as a form of steering. This paper describes our process to optimize the design of a coreless tubular linear generator for Moball so as to improve energy generation and motion control capabilities with the minimal moving generator mass. The performance of three different types of movers was analyzed with the help of finite element analysis. We determined a final optimized structure and its' dimensions involving a single dipole PM and novel slope-shaped back-irons. A prototype of a single-axis linear generator with a length of 0.8 m was fabricated and assembled. Drop and rotating tests were performed to measure the generated power with this machine. The maximum generated power in the rotating test was 1.05 W at 19 rpm when the load resistance was 40 Ω. The experimental results agreed well with our model predictions. The paper concludes with an overview of the current Moball prototype and ongoing work. The design process developed in this paper can serve as a guideline for future design of energy scavenging systems for robots.",

		"abstract": "The vibration damper installed on the overhead line is used to reduce the vibration caused by the wind. But the bolt of vibration damper will loosen and the damper will deviate from the mounting point to other locations because of continuing vibration. So that vibration damper recover robot has been design to improve work efficiency and reduce the risk of manual operation. The control system is the essential to ensure the robot to complete the resetting of the vibration damper. This paper, based on STM32 microprocessor, designed a set of reset robot control system including main control module, servo drive module, detection module, communication module and ground control unit. A set of control software is designed for these hardware, including the main program service module, the robot motion control module, the sensor information acquisition module and the communication protocol. Therefore the design of the control system including hardware and software of the vibration damper recover robot is completed. Through the remote control, the robot completed a series of tasks which contained line-patrol movement, reset operation and tightening the bolt. Furthermore, the control system designed in this paper has been experimentally verified, which reflects the feasibility and reliability of the control system.",

		"abstract": "We developed a 1-DOF power assist robot system for lifting objects by two humans cooperatively. We hypothesized that weight perception due to inertia might be different from that due to gravity when lifting an object with power-assist because the perceived weight differs from the actual weight. The system was simulated and two humans cooperatively lifted objects with it. We analyzed human features such as weight perception, load forces, motions etc. We found that the robot reduced the perceived weights to 25% of the actual weights, and the load forces were 8 times larger than the actual requirements. The excessive load forces resulted in excessive accelerations that jeopardized the performances. We then implemented a novel control based on the human features, which was such that a virtual mass exponentially declined from a large value to a small one when subjects lifted objects with the robot and the command velocity exceeded a threshold. The novel control reduced excessive load forces and accelerations and thus enhanced performances in terms of maneuverability, safety etc. The findings may be used to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that may augment human's abilities and skills and may improve interactions between robots and users.",

If individual robot movements in a system are preprocessed using Dynamic Programming, one can attain a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) which models the energy consumption of the complete system. This model can then be solved to optimality using mathematical programming. We have previously shown proof of concept for this energy reduction method. In this paper, we apply state of the art MINLP methods to a number of problems in order benchmark their effectiveness. Algorithms used are Nonlinear Programming based Branch and Bound (NLP-BB), Outer Approximation (OA), LP/NLP based Branch and Bound (LP/NLP-BB) and Extended Cutting Plane (ECP). Benchmarks show that the NLP-BB does not perform well for nonlinear scheduling problems. This is due to the weak lower bounds of the integer relaxations. For scheduling problems with nonlinear costs, ECP and in particular LP/NLP-BB are shown to outperform both NLP-BB and OA. The resulting energy optimal schedules for the examples show a significant decrease in energy consumption.",

The transformer primary core is in the charger unit, and the secondary core is in the robots. The transformer air-gap is equal to the distance between these two parts. By theoretical analysis, software simulations, and circuit implementation, the relationship among the transformer's coupling coefficient, the core geometry, and gap are formulated. In addition, a high-efficiency circuit topology for the studied contact-less charger is fulfilled. It is anticipated that the research results of this paper can contribute to the development of the contact-less charging techniques for robot systems. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Many theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out in order to develop autonomous robots to travel along telecommunication lines and power transmission lines to perform inspection and/or repair work. These robots can improve the efficiency, reduce labor and are expected to reduce the risks of accident of maintenance personnel. In spite of theoretical researches and technological developments of robotic systems, problems related to stability, controllability, ability to transpose/surmounting obstacles and autonomy still exist. Thus, this paper presents a mobile robot that moves suspended on electric power lines which can surmount different types of obstacles, placed at any position on cable. Firstly is presented a review of some existing robots. After, the kinematics model of the mobile robot and a methodology for spherical obstacle surmounting are presented. Finally, numerical and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed model.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes how parallel elastic elements can be used to reduce energy consumption in the electric-motor-driven, fully actuated, Sandia Transmission-Efficient Prototype Promoting Research (STEPPR) bipedal walking robot without compromising or significantly limiting locomotive behaviors. A physically motivated approach is used to illustrate how selectively engaging springs for hip adduction and ankle flexion predict benefits for three different flat-ground walking gaits: human walking, human-like robot walking, and crouched robot walking. Based on locomotion data, springs are designed and substantial reductions in power consumption are demonstrated using a bench dynamometer. These lessons are then applied to STEPPR, a fully actuated bipedal robot designed to explore the impact of tailored joint mechanisms on walking efficiency. Featuring high-torque brushless DC motors, efficient low-ratio transmissions, and high-fidelity torque control, STEPPR provides the ability to incorporate novel joint-level mechanisms without dramatically altering high-level control. Unique parallel elastic designs are incorporated into STEPPR, and walking data show that hip adduction and ankle flexion springs significantly reduce the required actuator energy at those joints for several gaits. These results suggest that parallel joint springs offer a promising means of supporting quasi-static joint torques due to body mass during walking, relieving motors of the need to support these torques and substantially improving locomotive energy efficiency.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of indocyanine green angiography more than 25 years ago, few studies have presented interpretative guidelines for indocyanine green fluorescent imaging.\n        OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide interpretative guidelines for indocyanine green fluorescent imaging through quantitative analysis and to suggest possible indications for indocyanine green fluorescent imaging during robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations.\n        DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study.\n        SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a single center.\n        PATIENTS: A cohort of 657 patients with rectal cancer who consecutively underwent curative robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations was enrolled between 2010 and 2016, including 310 patients with indocyanine green imaging (indocyanine green fluorescent imaging+ group) and 347 patients without indocyanine green imaging (indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group).\n        MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We tried to quantitatively define the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging findings based on perfusion (mesocolic and colic) time and perfusion intensity (5 grades) to provide probable indications.\n        RESULTS: The anastomotic leakage rate was significantly lower in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging+ group than in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group (0.6% vs 5.2%) (OR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.028–0.544; p = 0.006). Anastomotic stricture was closely correlated with anastomotic leakage (p = 0.002) and a short descending mesocolon (p = 0.003). Delayed perfusion (>60 s) and low perfusion intensity (1–2) were more frequently detected in patients with anastomotic stricture and marginal artery defects than in those without these factors (p ≤ 0.001). In addition, perfusion times greater than the mean were more frequently observed in patients aged >58 years, whereas low perfusion intensity was seen more in patients with short descending mesocolon and high ASA classes (≥3).\n        LIMITATIONS: The 300 patients in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group underwent operations 3 years before indocyanine green fluorescent imaging.\n        CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of indocyanine green fluorescent imaging may help prevent anastomotic complications during robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations, and may be of particular value in high-class ASA patients, older patients, and patients with a short descending mesocolon.",

Brachiating is the hand over hand swinging locomotion used by various primates, especially the long armed apes, and the manner of moving like a long armed ape is called brachiation. By analyzing the behavior of the long armed ape, which moves from branch to branch swinging its body like a pendulum, the basic principle and brachiating control of the simplified 2-link brachiation robot is studied. In this paper we present the energy based nonlinear control method to control the swing manner of brachiation, and a feed back control law is designed using the Lyapunov stability theory. The target brachiation is an effective locomotion from one bar to another by exchanging kinetic energy with potential energy like a pendulum, which the same as the real long armed ape uses. Finally the experimental results on a 2-link-model brachiation robot show feasibility of the developed controller design scheme.",

		"abstract": "Many kinds of power-assist robots have been developed in order to assist daily life motions of the elderly or physically weak persons. A human upper-limb has 7 degrees of freedom to achieve various tasks dexterously. Therefore, to assist all upper-limb joint motions of a human, the upper-limb power-assist robot is required to have 7DOF. On the other hand, to achieve a desired task, a person moves own hand to the desired position and orientation. For this reason, the hand position or hand force must be focused to be controlled by the upper-limb power-assist robots. However, the hand position or hand force is 6-dimensional vector, so the 7DOF upper-limb power-assist robot has a redundancy and in general, a pseudo-inverse matrix is used in the control. In this paper, the torque optimization for an upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton robot using the pseudo-inverse matrix is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by the experiments.",

In order to assist daily motion of the physically weak persons, the robot must estimate the motion intention of the user in real-time. Although there are several kinds of method to estimate the motion intention of the user in real-time, Electromyogram (EMG) signals are often used to estimate that since they reflect the users muscle activities. However, EMG-based real-time motion estimation is not very easy because of several reasons. In this chapter, an EMG-based control method is introduced to control the power-assist lower-limb exoskeleton robot in accordance with users motion intention. A neuro-fuzzy modifier is applied to deal with those problems. The problems of EMG-based motion estimation are cleared by applying the neuro-fuzzy modifier.Sometimes there is a problem in the users motion even though the users motion is assisted, if the user misunderstands interaction between the users motion and a surrounding environment. In that case, the users motion should be modified to avoid an accident. In this chapter, a method of perception-assist is also introduced to automatically modify the users motion properly.",

		"abstract": "China became the world’s largest market for industrial robots in 2013. The robotic revolution gained pace and occurred after the 2008 financial crisis as many export-oriented firms coped with dwindling orders, rising labour costs and growing concerns over occupational safety. Unlike workers in the Global North who experienced automation in the 1960s and 1970s against a backdrop of strong union activism, whether semi-proletarian peasant-workers in China ultimately enjoy the ‘beneficial’ effects of industrial upgrading is questionable. However, very little social science research has investigated how automation, in light of the negative consequences of unemployment and deskilling, can continue to be advanced. Drawing on Beverley Silver’s concept of workers’ power, this article explores how workers’ marketplace and workplace bargaining power interfaces with technological change. The Chinese case may offer important lessons to those in the under-technologized South seeking to conceptualize strategies for social change in the context of industrial upgrading.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the development of a mobile robot capable of clearing such obstacles as counterweights, crimp connection pipes, anchor clamps, and torsion tower. The mobile robot suspends on overhead ground wires of power transmission lines. Its ultimate purpose is to automate the inspection of power transmission line equipment. The robot with 13 motors has two arms and each arm has 4 degree of freedom. Claws are also mounted on the arms. An embedded computer and an opto-isolator I/O module based on PC/104 bus are chosen as the core of control system. A video capture card is installed to obtain the video information from cameras, and the communication system is based on wireless LAN TCP/IP protocol. An expert system based visual C++ is adopted to implement the automatic control. The energy source is a rechargeable voltage-regulated lithium-ion battery that can provide the power peaks required by the most demanding tasks and sufficient energy for a full day of operation. A prototype with careful considerations on mobility was built. The new posture plan is proposed for obstacles cleaning in the torsion tower. Results of experiments demonstrate that the robot can be applied to execute the navigation and inspection tasks.",

		"abstract": "In this work we develop a novel method, or mechanism, of energy transfer in a quadruped running robot. The robot possesses only one actuator per leg, for lower weight and greater power autonomy. The developed mechanism ensures correct dispersion of energy to the actuated and the unactuated degrees of freedom of the robot for stable running. In the mechanism design, we address the added problem of running on inclined ground. In conjunction with a pitch control method, the energy transfer mechanism forms a complete control algorithm. Due to the novel dynamics-based design of the mechanism, it allows the arbitrary setting of the motion forward speed and apex height. Further, it may be applied for different robot physical parameters and ground inclines, without extensive controller tuning. This has not been previously possible using only one actuator per leg. Simulations of a detailed three-dimensional model of the robot demonstrate the mechanism on two different robots. The simulations take into account many real-world characteristics, including realistic leg models, energy loss due to feet collisions, foot–ground friction and energy losses in the joints. Results demonstrate that inclines of up to 20° are properly negotiated.",

We have proposed an optimal trajectory planning method based on a function approximation method, and applied it for 2D biped walking model. With this method, we obtained the solution of minimal square integration value of the input torque. Before that, this method only includes equality state constraint, but in this paper, also includes inequality state constraint to restrict the range of joint angle. In addition, we performed the walking experiment to verify the effectiveness of this method. We realized the stable walking of 0.6 s period and 0.3 m/s.

		"abstract": "To replace human beings for a task conducted in a realistic environment, the ability to perform impact motions such as running, jumping, and carrying is required for a humanoid robot. At present, it is quite difficult for the humanoid robot to achieve the motion performance of human beings. To address this issue, this article proposes to use a novel impact motion control method for a humanoid robot called BHR-5 using energy integral method. First, we have designed a high power density joint controller to drive each brushless motor to actuate each robot joint. The joint controller can generate sufficient power to actuate the robot joint with an instantaneous overload when limiting the input power in a unit interval. Second, the control system can generate trajectories to realize impact motion by integrating the energy of the whole body. Finally, we have conducted performance test on BHR-5 to verify the control method using our motor drivers and trajectory generation method. Analysis of the experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control method for performing impact motions.",

This paper is aimed to develop a power scheduling algorithm to evaluate the loading effects of the LiFePO4 battery system on the caterpillar robot. A PC-based platform with the human-machine interface (HMI) is applied to detect each of the modulized servo-motors and sensors.

		"abstract": "Nowadays, robots generally have a variety of capabilities, which often form a coalition replacing human to work in dangerous environment, such as rescue, exploration, etc. In these operating conditions, the energy supply of robots usually cannot be guaranteed. If the energy resources of some robots are consumed too fast, the number of the future tasks of the coalition will be affected. This paper will develop a novel task allocation method based on Gini coefficient to make full use of limited energy resources of multi-robot system to maximize the number of tasks. At the same time, considering resources consumption, we incorporate the market-based allocation mechanism into our Gini coefficient-based method and propose a hybrid method, which can flexibly optimize the task completion number and the resource consumption according to the application contexts. Experiments show that the multi-robot system with limited energy resources can accomplish more tasks by the proposed Gini coefficient-based method, and the hybrid method can be dynamically adaptive to changes of the work environment and realize the dual optimization goals.",

		"abstract": "Two control approaches are presented to improve the energy efficiency of a robot which has to perform point-to-point motions during a fixed time interval. One is called Proximate Energy Optimal Servo (PEOS) and the other is called Energy-Optimal Model Predictive Control (EOMPC). The PEOS approach is based on the Proximate Time Optimal Servo (PTOS) control algorithm whose parameters are optimized in order to achieve energy efficient behavior. The EOMPC approach developed based on the Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control (TOMPC) approach achieves energy optimal performance by minimizing the energy losses in the object function. The two developed approaches are applied to a robot playing badminton and compared to two existing control approaches: the Proximate Time Optimal Servo (PTOS) and the Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control (TOMPC). The robot is still able to intercept most of the opponent shuttles on time, while a significant reduction of the energy consumption is demonstrated in both cases.",

Monitoring the status of the battery power on the robot is therefore important for autonomous robotic systems. The wireless system for monitoring lead–acid battery of obstacle avoidance robot has been developed. The system employs sensors, microcontroller ATMEGA 328, and Bluetooth module. The parameters such as voltage and current of battery are checked by the battery monitoring system during discharging of the battery. The varying discharging voltage and current values of the battery are detected using voltage divider circuit and Hall Effect current sensor, respectively. Battery voltage and current data will be transferred in real time to the microcontroller, and then it will be transmitted to display device using Bluetooth communication. In this work, monitored battery data will be displayed on Microsoft Excel of laptop Personal Computer (PC) with Parallax Data Acquisition tool (PLX-DAQ). The real-time data of voltage and current will be indicated by the system in the tabulated form along with graphical display.",

		"abstract": "The integrity of components of an operating nuclear power plant (NPP) is usually monitored on a daily basis by operator patrols. Currently, there is a great need to replace such human patrol activities by systems of automated remote monitoring in order to reduce radiation exposure and the severe workload imposed on operators. From this perspective, and under the sponsorship of Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the authors embarked upon a R&D project in 1991 with the objective of developing an autonomous mobile patrol system for NPPs. The project is scheduled to be completed in 1996. This paper describes the concept of the autonomous mobile robot system, which comprises a hierarchical autonomous mobile control system, a localization system based on pattern matching between the data profile from a laser rangefinder and an environment map, a method of constructing environment maps from 3D-CAD of a NPP, and a cableless robot system.",

		"abstract": "Recently, bilateral arm training has attracted great attention in the development of rehabilitation robots to provide therapy for hemiplegic patients with a unilaterally disabled limb. It has been proved that bilateral arm exercise can stimulate ipsilateral corticospinal pathways and enhance recovery; also the coordination of the two limbs can reduce hypertonia and abnormal synergies compared to unilateral limb training. In conventional bilateral arm training robots, the healthy limb provides a reference movement and the robot gives an assistant force for the impaired limb to implement mirror image movements, or the healthy limb assists the impaired limb to accomplish the desired movement, whereas no resistant force was supplied for patients with the healthy limb to perform strength enhancement training. This paper introduces a novel master- slave rehabilitation robot to implement bilateral arm coordinated training. The robot supports passive, active-assisted, and active-constrained training modes. No matter in which mode, the corresponding force provided for the impaired limb is from the healthy limb. A prototype was developed with two identical motors. A subject controls the two motors with his/her two limbs to accomplish desired movements. Preliminary tests were conducted, the results conﬁrm the validity of the system in diﬀerent training modes, and verify the system’s force sensing capability, energy recycling function, and bidirectional controllability.",

An attempt has been made to formulate energy efﬁcient trajectories for the dual-arm robot such that the reaction moments acting on the base satellite are minimum. To achieve this, ﬁrst a local optimization problem is formulated exploiting redundancy associated with the constraints for reactionless manipulation. This method, however, fails to provide optimal trajectories. In order to overcome this disadvantage, an optimal control problem is formulated which not only helps in achieving energy efﬁcient trajectories but also ensures zero reaction moments to the base satellite. The proposed method is validated using a 6-link planar dual-arm robot mounted on a service satellite.",

Findings Overall, it was found that male and female customers with different cultural background would perceive robot and human personnel with varying degrees of head tilt very differently, namely, regarding interpersonal warmth but not customer satisfaction. Originality/value Nonverbal cues serve as important elements in the interaction. This paper provides new directions on the design of anthropomorphic robot and gives insight to people’s perceptual differences. All in all, the present study is useful in facilitating human–robot interactions.",

The ability to predict when power will be depleted beyond a certain point is necessary for recharging or returning to a base station. This paper presents a framework for forecasting state of charge (SOC) of a robot's battery for a given mission. A generalized and customizable mission description is formulated as a sequence of parametrized tasks defined for the robot; the missions are then mapped to expected change in SOC by training neural networks on experimental data. We present results from experiments on the Turtlebot 2 to establish the efficacy of this framework. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated for three distinct mission representations and compared to an existing method in the literature. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of feedforward and recurrent neural network models in the context of this work.",

		"abstract": "Energy expenditure (EE) is an important criterion for design and control of biped walking robots. However, the cause-effect analyses enabled by total EE, which is lumped over a time duration and all system degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), are limited. In this study, robotic gait energetics is evaluated through a DOF-based instrumentation system designed for instantaneous evaluation of bidirectional current and applied voltage at each joint actuator. The instrumentation system includes a dual-module arrangement of buffers and attenuators, and accommodates and synchronizes the voltage and current measurements from multiple actuators. For illustrative purposes, this system is implemented at each DC servomotor in a biped robot, DARwIn-OP, to analyze the electrical EE rates for walking at various speeds. In addition, a DOF-based model of instantaneous human EE rate is employed to enable quantitative characterization of robotic walking EE relative to that of humans. The robot's instantaneous lower-body EE rates are consistent with its periodic walking cycle, and their relative trends between single and double support phases are analogous to those of humans. The robotic cost of transport (COT) curve as a function of normalized speed is also consistent with the human COT in terms of its convexity. Conversely, the contrasting distributions of EE throughout the robot and human DOFs and the robotic COT curve's considerably larger magnitudes, smaller speed ranges, and higher sensitivity to speed illustrate the energetic consequences of stable but inefficient static walking in the biped robot relative to the more efficient dynamic walking of humans. These energetic characteristics enable the identification of the joints and gait cycle phases associated with inefficiency in biped robotic gait, and reflect the noticeable differences in the system parameters (rigid and flat versus segmented feet) and gait control strategies (bent versus straight knees, instants of peak ankle actuator torques, static versus dynamic balance stability). The proposed general instrumentation provides a quantitative approach to benchmarking human gait as well as general guidelines for the development of energy-efficient walking robots.",

Service robots demands for an intelligent processing of images and sounds for smooth communication between a robot and a human working. These processes are computationally intensive, and real-time processing is often difficult in software processing by the CPU. Since it is necessary to integrate various hardware and software into the robot to operate it, to make development more efficient, utilization of open source construction of a rapid prototyping environment is indispensable. In the paper, to accelerate the intelligent processing, we use an FPGA as a hardware accelerator on a robot. Also, in order to improve development efficiency, we use a robot operating system (ROS). We implemented YOLOv2 (You Only Look Once version 2) which is one type of object recognition. Compared with a CPU and a GPU, an FPGA based accelerator was superior in power performance efficiency.",

Often this working environment has rich scattering and so the wireless channel will experience small scale fading. In this paper we develop an algorithm whereby the robot visits a specific number of locations with a pre-determined geometry, and transmits its data from one of these locations in an optimum way that minimizes the overall energy consumption. We show analytically (and via simulation) that this approach can both reduce the total energy required and obtain a diversity gain for robotic wireless communications.",

This approach was tested in simulation on a numerical model of the Hydroïd robot of the Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes de Versailles, and achieved a dynamic walking with a 1.3 m/s maximum speed and the crossing of an obstacle thanks to inertia forces, by leaning with the front foot on the obstacle. The propulsion energy of the system is produced by the rear leg, endowed with four actuated degrees-of-freedom (hip, knee, ankle, toes), and controlled by a force control using four degrees-of-freedom in the non singular case, and three degrees-of-freedom in the singular case.",

		"abstract": "In this work, the energy-optimal motion planning problem for planar robot manipulators with two revolute joints is studied, in which the end-effector of the robot manipulator is constrained to pass through a set of waypoints, whose sequence is not predefined. This multi-goal motion planning problem has been solved as a mixed-integer optimal control problem in which, given the dynamic model of the robot manipulator, the initial and final configurations of the robot, and a set of waypoints inside the workspace of the manipulator, one has to find the control inputs, the sequence of waypoints with the corresponding passage times, and the resulting trajectory of the robot that minimizes the energy consumption during the motion. The presence of the waypoint constraints makes this optimal control problem particularly difficult to solve. The mixed-integer optimal control problem has been converted into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem first making the unknown passage times through the waypoints part of the state, then introducing binary variables to enforce the constraint of passing once through each waypoint, and finally applying a fifth-degree Gauss–Lobatto direct collocation method to tackle the dynamic constraints. High-degree interpolation polynomials allow the number of variables of the problem to be reduced for a given numerical precision. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem has been solved using a nonlinear programming-based branch-and-bound algorithm specifically tailored to the problem. The results of the numerical experiments have shown the effectiveness of the approach.",

		"abstract": "This article describes the design and field evaluation of a low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping robot for energy sorghum for use in biofuel production. High-throughput phenotyping approaches have been used in isolated growth chambers or greenhouses, but there is a growing need for field-based, precision agriculture techniques to measure large quantities of plants at high spatial and temporal resolutions throughout a growing season. A low-cost, tracked mobile robot was developed to collect phenotypic data for individual plants and tested on two separate energy sorghum fields in Central Illinois during summer 2016. Stereo imaging techniques determined plant height, and a depth sensor measured stem width near the base of the plant. A data capture rate of 0.4 ha, bi-weekly, was demonstrated for platform robustness consistent with various environmental conditions and crop yield modeling needs, and formative human–robot interaction observations were made during the field trials to address usability. This work is of interest to researchers and practitioners advancing the field of plant breeding because it demonstrates a new phenotyping platform that can measure individual plant architecture traits accurately (absolute measurement error at 15% for plant height and 13% for stem width) over large areas at a sub-daily frequency; furthermore, the design of this platform can be extended for phenotyping applications in maize or other agricultural row crops.",

The variable structure controller (VSC) is designed to track the trajectories and compensate LuGre model of frictional torque effects. The robot system is described by a mechanical equation and an electrical equation. To generate the minimum-energy trajectory, we employ a high-degree polynomial with suitable end-point conditions. The real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) is used to search for the coefﬁcients of the polynomial with the ﬁtness function of minimum-energy input. Finally, numerical simulations of the minimum-energy inputs are compared for various degrees of polynomials.

This paper presents a dynamic model for determining energy consumption and energy efficiency of a hexapod robot during its locomotion over flat terrain with a constant crab angle. The model has been derived for statically stable crab-wave gaits by considering a minimization of dissipating energy for optimal foot force distribution. Two approaches, such as minimization of norm of feet forces and minimization of norm of joint torques have been developed. The variations of average power consumption and energy consumption per weight per traveled length with velocity or stroke have been compared for crab walking with tripod and tetrapod gait patterns.

		"abstract": "Background\nVideo capsule endoscopy is a useful tool for noninvasive intestinal detection, but it is not capable of active movement; wireless power is an effective solution to this problem.\nMethods\nThe research in this paper consists of two parts: the mechanical structure which enables the robot to move smoothly inside the intestinal tract, and the wireless power supply which ensures efficiency. First, an intestinal robot with leg architectures was developed based on the Archimedes spiral, which mimics the movement of an inchworm. The spiral legs were capable of unfolding to an angle of approximately 155°, which guaranteed stability of clamping, consistency of surface pressure, and avoided the risk of puncturing the intestinal tract. Secondly, the necessary power to operate the robot was far beyond the capacity of button batteries, so a wireless power transmission (WPT) platform was developed. The design of the platform focused on power transfer efficiency and frequency stability. In addition, the safety of human tissue in the alternating electromagnetic field was also taken into consideration. Finally, the assembled robot was tested and verified with the use of the WPT platform.\nResults\nIn the isolated intestine, the robot system successfully traveled along the intestine with an average speed of 23mm per minute. The obtained videos displayed a resolution of 320×240 and a transmission rate of 30 frames per second. The WPT platform supplied up to 500mW of energy to the robot, and achieved a power transfer efficiency of 12%.\nConclusion\nIt has been experimentally verified that the intestinal robot is safe and effective as an endoscopy tool, for which wireless power is feasible. Proposals for further improving the robot and wireless power supply are provided later in this paper.",

		"abstract": "A novel mechanism for 110 kV power transmission line inspection is presented according to the requirements of inspection tasks and characteristics of obstacles on power transmission lines. Its configuration is introduced, and the navigation process of typical obstacles is planned. Then the kinematics equations and the workspace are derived. The grade ability of the power transmission line inspection robot is analysed and then improved by some measures. The quasi-static mode of the robot and the contact mechanics of the wheels are established. Adhesion force of the driving wheel can be improved by optimizing the structure of the wheel and the wheel load is reasonably distributed by planning the posture of the robot. So the climbing ability is ameliorated. The climbing ability of the different wheel structure and the different posture is simulated. Furthermore, the simulation of the navigation of the strain clamp and test of navigation of the jumper in the laboratory have been carried out. The simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism has such characteristics as compact construction, strong stability and excellent obstacle negotiation capability.",

		"abstract": "Power assist robot (PAR) would be of great value to certain human activities or for special groups such as the aged and the weakling. If PAR can provide appropriate power assist, it would be more effective to adapt to human intention accordingly, otherwise, it would be a burden to human body, especially for those have difficulty in standing up and sitting down. In this paper, in order to realize proper power assist during human's standing up, a method for recognizing successive phases during a subject performing sit-to-stand motion is proposed. By using of surface electromyographic (EMG) signal sampled from lower limb combined with floor reaction force (FRF) which indicates the position of centre of gravity (COG) of some a subject, sufficient information for sit-to-stand could be recorded when the subject stands up from the chair. In succession, characteristics of the recorded signals are extracted. As it is expected for high recognition rate and rather robustness method, neural network ensemble (NNE, hereafter) technology is selected to identify each phase included in standing up.",

		"abstract": "Mesoscale robots, including active capsules, are a promising and well suited approach for minimal invasive intrabody intervention. However, within the numerous works, the main limitation in these robots is the embedded energy used for their locomotion and for the tasks they should accomplish. The limited autonomy and the limited power make them finally unusable for real situations such as active capsules inside body during several tens of minutes. In this paper, we propose an approach to power mesoscale robots by using energy harvesting techniques through a piezoelectric cantilever structure embedded on the robot and through an oscillating magnetic excitation. The physical model of the proposed system is carried out and simulation results are yielded and analyzed accordingly to the influencing parameters such as the number of layers in the cantilever and its dimensions. Finally, the feasability of this solution is proved and perspectives are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Since the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan 2011, a lot of robot has been developed on behalf of human in the disaster. But they are not capable of coping with the disaster yet. The main reasons are the lack of bipedal walking technology on uneven terrain and short operating time due to low energy efficiency during walking. In the case of the existing bipedal walking robot which is driven by actuators in each joint, energy efficiency is poor because moment of inertia and mass are high due to heavy actuators located far from the rotational axis. To solve this problem, this paper suggests the six degree-of-freedom robot leg using the four-bar linkage mechanism with high rigidity. The actuator of the knee joint and ankle joint are positioned on the hip to reduce the leg mass and moment of inertia. Our aim is bipedal walking robot lower body design to increase the energy efficiency and walk on highspeed. To do so, we designed the robot lower body that has optimal dimension to endure external forces with minimum mass. And we simulated the result of each joint trajectory, torque and energy efficiency based on the designed model to generate a walking pattern. We will produce the actual robot lower body in detail based on the derived data, and compare to the existing robots' performance.",

A snake robot comprises many modules and performs various movements in arranged connections. The structure of a snake body enables it to move smoothly in narrow spaces or pipes with high stability and reliability. This article studies the application of a snake robot on a large-scale nuclear power facility to sense in pipe components. Therefore, a snake robot must move in pipes in which high radiation is present to explore the surrounding environment and take samples. A simple but effective method of locomotion is developed and executed to confirm feasibility of motion, especially in narrow space. A sampling mechanism with a storage box is designed at the tail of the snake to take and keep the samples well at designated locations. We built a pipe system which has two right-angled turns to simulate the pipes of a large-scale nuclear power facility. A user interface helps operators to manipulate the snake robot.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents our initial work on how emotion based behaviors may emerge through computational mechanisms. We hold that in addition to basic emotions such as anger and fear that serves bodily well being of the organism, high level emotions such as boredom and affection have evolved to facilitate low cost brain computations. Higher level of emotions can be considered as affective state of the organism or mood, rather than the reflex-like physiologically triggered emotional responses such as fear and anger. In large and complex brains (e.g. primate brains), the neuronal energy consumption for cognition is non-negligible. We propose that for such organisms computational regulatory mechanisms for decision making give rise to behaviors that can be explained by various emotional states. As a proof of concept for this idea, we envision a robotic cognitive system and a select function that we assign a neural cost for its operation. To be concrete, we use a small humanoid robot platform (Darwin-OP) and implement a neural network (Hopfield Network) that allows the robot to recall learned patterns that it sees through its camera. As a model of neural computational energy consumption, we postulate that a change in the state of a neural unit of the network consumes one unit of (neural) energy. Therefore, the total computational energy consumed is determined by the incoming stimuli. The robot is programmed to avoid high energy consumption by showing aversive behavior when the energy consumption is high. Otherwise, the robot demonstrates engaging behavior. For an external observer these responses may be perceived as robot's having certain emotional (affectional) preference for input stimuli. In this article in addition to robot experiments, we also emphasize the biological support for our proposal and provide detailed exposition of biological background and its relevance for the hypothesis that (certain) emotions may emerge through computational mechanisms.",

		"abstract": "Even though many humanoid robots have been developed and they have locomotion ability, their balancing ability is not sufficient. In the future, humanoid robots will work and act within the human environment. At that time, the humanoid robot will be exposed to various disturbances. This paper proposes a balancing strategy for hopping humanoid robots against various magnitude of disturbance. The proposed balancing strategy for a hopping humanoid robot consists of two controllers, the posture balance controller and the landing position controller. The posture balance controller is used for small disturbances, and its role is to maintain stability by controlling the ankle torque of the robot. On the other hand, if disturbance is large, the landing position controller, which changes the landing position of the swing foot, works with the posture balance controller simultaneously. In this way, the landing position controller reduces large disturbances, and the posture balance controller controls the remaining disturbances. The landing position controller is derived by the principle of energy conservation. An experiment conducted with a real humanoid robot, HUBO2, verifies the proposed method. HUBO2 made a stable and continuous hopping action with the proposed balancing strategy overcoming various disturbances placed in the way of the robot.",

It utilizes a stationary network of passive infrared sensor nodes interconnected through a multi-hop Zigbee network. The sensors are motion sensitive and using regional localization can be used for identifying the location of survivors or intruders based on the situation. The robot is controlled via a Wi-fi link which streams real time video back to the base station. The main processor is a TI Sitara AM335x ARM processor. It also acts as relay for the sensor data. Each node consists of three passive infrared detection circuits each covering a sector of 120 degrees and connects via the TI CC2530 ZNP chip. The raw PIR data is signal conditioned using an LM324 Op-amp. The nodes can be deployed easily due to their compact size.

For flexibility and accuracy of the neural network, floating point based computation method is applied. The proposed model uses the principle of reconfigurability which reduces the implementation cost and area. In this proposed architecture of autonomous mobile robot, pipelined architecture is used which increases the speed and reduces the delay for the prediction.

The analysis considers motor dynamics during standing up and sitting down tasks. The motion tasks of the humanoid are described in terms of joint position, joint velocity, joint acceleration, joint torque, center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure (CoP). To reduce the complexity of the robot analysis, the humanoid is modeled as a planar robot with four links and three joints. The humanoid robot learns to reduce the overall motion torque by applying Q-Learning in a simulated model. The resulting motions are evaluated on a physical NAO humanoid robot during standing up and sitting down tasks and then contrasted to a pre-programmed task in the NAO. The stand up and sit down motions are analyzed for individual joint current usage, power demand, torque, angular velocity, acceleration, CoM and CoP locations. The overall result is improved energy efficiency between 25–30% when compared to the pre-programmed NAO stand up and sit down motion task.",

		"abstract": "For many years, the human being has been trying, in all ways, to recreate the complex mechanisms that form the human body. Such task is extremely complicated and the results are not totally satisfactory. However, with increasing technological advances based on theoretical and experimental researches, man gets, in a way, to copy or to imitate some systems of the human body. These researches not only intended to create humanoid robots, great part of them constituting autonomous systems, but also, in some way, to offer a higher knowledge of the systems that form the human body, objectifying possible applications in the technology of rehabilitation of human beings, gathering in a whole studies related not only to Robotics, but also to Biomechanics, Biomimmetics, Cybernetics, among other areas. This book presents a series of researches inspired by this ideal, carried through by various researchers worldwide, looking for to analyze and to discuss diverse subjects related to humanoid robots. The presented contributions explore aspects about robotic hands, learning, language, vision and locomotion.",

		"abstract": "The success of numerous long-term robotic explorations in the air, on the ground, and under the water is dependent on the ability of robots to operate for an extended time. The long-term ubiquitous operation of robots hinges on smart energy consumption and the replenishment of the robots. This paper provides a heuristic method for planning missions that extend over multiple battery lives of working robots. This method simultaneously generates energy efficient trajectories for multiple robots, and schedules energy cycling using static charging stations through the mission. The mission planning algorithm accounts for environmental obstacles, current, and can adapt to a priority search distribution. The simulation results for a scenario similar to the MH370 airplane search mission demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm in area coverage and handling environmental constraints. The robustness of the developed method is evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is tested in simulation environment in Gazebo and implemented and experimentally validated for an in-lab aerial coverage scenario with an obstacle and a priority mission area.",

This study is concerned with such issues for a six-legged rough terrain walking vehicle power system that includes the associated control systems. The power system of the vehicle can be divided into three broad categories: leg systems, mechanical transmission system, and the primary power source and energy storage system. Modeling techniques, detailed analytical models, and a comprehensive nonlinear digital simulation are developed for precise performance predictions, interaction studies, parametric studies, and to aid in the mechanical and control design process. Validation of the models is provided by several experiments performed on a prototype leg and the vehicle.

		"abstract": "In most of gravity balancing approaches devoted to robot manipulators, the gravity compensation is carried out for cancelling of the static efforts due to robot element masses, as well as a fixed payload. When the pay-load is variable, i.e. if for each cycle of the robot operation it is different, the known compensation techniques are not efficient. Some solutions permitting to compensate the gravity effects of variable payloads have been developed. However, they have similar drawbacks. To adapt the robot to the changing payload it is necessary: i) to increase the number of actuators and ii) to bring energy inside the system , i.e. the adaption technique is not energy efficient. This paper deals with a new gravity-compensation system for cancellation of the static loads of the changing pay-load. It is shown that the adaption to a new manipulated payload does not need to bring energy inside the system, i.e. the adaption technique is energy efficient. Simulations of the suggested mechanism by using ADAMS software are performed and show the efficiency of the proposed solution.",

The EMEH is designed with a dual-core where Silicon (Si) and Nickel (Ni) steels have been used in order to take advantage of both materials characteristics. An analytical model for the EMEH has been proposed in this paper which is compared with the 3D finite element method (FEM) based model of the EMEH under the same design specification. Moreover, considering the magnetic equivalent circuit model of the EMEH, equivalent circuit parameters are determined. Furthermore, to obtain the impedance matching and to extract the maximum real power from the EMEH, power optimization circuit consisting of a capacitor and a buck-boost converter is proposed and the parameters for the power optimization circuit are evaluated. To validate the effectiveness of the EMEH and its power optimization circuit, a co-simulation design platform is developed using the 3D-FEM and MATLAB coupled in a python-based environment. On the co-simulation platform, the charging of a rechargeable battery of 15 V is verified.",

		"abstract": "We work with geoscientists studying erosion and desertification to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of their data collection over long transects in difficult realworld environments such as deserts [1]. The Minitaur [2] robot, which can run quickly over uneven terrain and use a single leg to measure relevant ground properties such as stiffness [3], is an attractive scout robot candidate for inclusion in a heterogeneous team in collaboration with a heavily geared, sensor-laden RHex [4]. However, Minitaur is challenged by long-distance locomotion on sand dunes. Previous simulation results [5] suggested that the energetic cost of transport can be mitigated by programming a virtual damping force to slow the intrusion of a Minitaur foot into simulated granular media following a bulk-behavior force law [6]. In this paper, we present a ground emulator that can be used to test such locomotion hypotheses with a physical single-legged hopper jumping on emulated ground programmed to exhibit any compliance and damping characteristics of interest. The new emulator allows us to corroborate the conclusions of our previous simulation with physical hopping experiments. Programming the substrate emulator to exhibit the mechanics of a simplified bulk-behavior model of granular media characterized by linear stiffness and quadratic damping, we achieve a consistent energy savings of 20% in comparison with a nominal controller, with savings of up to 50% under specific conditions.",

Bionics has made a great progress and appeared all kinds of biologic design and application for robot. This paper describes the development of a mobile robot capable of negotiation such obstacles as electric power fitting, damper, anchor clamp, and torsion tower. The mobile robot suspends on overhead ground wires of 500KV power towers. Its ultimate purpose is to automate the inspection of power transmission line equipment. Biology principle of the movement of the monkey is taken as reference prototype to design and produce the inspection robot driven by 13 motor with two arms, two wheels, two wrists, two claws and a box. The inspection robot is designed to realize the function of observation, grasp, walk, rolling, turn, rise, and decline. An embedded computer based on PC/104 bus is chosen as the core of control system. A video capture card and thermal infrared camera are installed to obtain the temperature information of the power transmission lines, and the communication system between the robot and the ground station is based on wireless LAN TCP/IP protocol. An expert system programmed with Visual C++ is developed to implement the automatic control. A novel prototype with careful considerations on mobility was designed to inspect the 500KV power transmission lines. The new control algorithm of posture plan is proposed for obstacles cleaning in the torsion tower. Results of experiments demonstrate that the robot can be applied to execute the navigation and inspection tasks.",

In a single round, each robot may be allowed to visit only one event (matching dispatch), or several events in a sequence (sequence dispatch). In a distributed setting, each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot. Here, we present novel algorithms aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of several existing solutions. We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints. Our localized algorithm MAD is based on information mesh infrastructure and local auctions within the robot network for obtaining the optimal dispatch schedule for each robot. The simulations conducted confirm the advantages of our algorithms over other existing solutions in terms of average robot-event distance and lifetime.",

The objective is to build a coherent representation of the environment in minimum time. This can be achieved by applying an efficient coordination method which assigns to each robot the appropriate target location. In this context, we present a decentralized coordination approach that takes into account the structure of the environment and the energy consumption of each robot favouring a well-balanced spatial distribution of the robots in this one. The exploration target is the segment of environment including the frontiers between the unknown and the explored areas. The robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in term of energy consumption to reach this target. Thus, the robot is assigned to the segment for which it has the lowest rank. This approach has been implemented and tested in computerized simulation and a comparison with some existing approaches has been performed. The results demonstrate that our approach distributes efficiently the robots over the environment which allows to reduce the overall exploration time.",

		"abstract": "In cyclic scheduling of material handling robots in manufacturing cells, a common approach is to minimize the cycle time objective, which is a measure of the throughput of the cell. In a typical robot move cycle, robot move times constitute a significant portion of the cycle time. During handling operations, robots consume significant amount of energy, which is determined by their speed, load and the distance they travel. In this paper, we propose considering robot speed decisions along with robot move sequencing decisions in a robotic cell scheduling problem. We study the trade-off between the cycle time and the energy consumption of a robot in a robotic cell which produces identical parts. In this cell, the robot loads and unloads the machines. Each machine performs a different operation on a part and the robot moves linearly along a track. We provide models to find efficient solutions for cycle time and robot energy consumption objectives in an m-machine robotic cell. In a case study for two machine robotic cell, we show that robot speed control can lead to significant savings in energy consumption.",

		"abstract": "Task offloading plays a critical role in cloud networked multi-robot systems for leveraging computation support from cloud infrastructure and benefiting greatly from the well-developed cloud network facilities. However, considering the delay constraint, the extra costs of data transmission and remote computation, it is not trivial to make optimized offloading decisions. In particular, task offloading for robots is more complex due to their on-demand mobility and network connectivity that significantly influence the robot–cloud communication links. Moreover, for multi-robot systems, a suitable balance of workload between local network (robot–robot) and global cloud (robot–cloud) is also required, so as to attain proper utilization of resources. Therefore, it is essential to establish more comprehensive offloading schemes for modeling systems that can handle these higher level of complications. With that view, this paper aims to develop a novel multi-layer decision-making scheme for task offloading which jointly considers the following four aspects: (i) selection of task for offloading, (ii) selection of robot to offload a task, (iii) selection of location to offload/perform task, (iv) selection of access point for offloaded task. An integrated framework for cloud networked multi-robot systems is presented to enable our task offloading scheme where the primary robot can aid from additional local robots to improve the offloading process. In particular, we consider a warehouse scenario with 36 cell workspace where a 40 node taskflow is motivated from a “parcel sorting and distribution” application, to be completed by the primary robot. The offloading decision for each task is formulated as part of a joint optimization problem and it is solved by developing a multi-layer genetic algorithm scheme that takes into account motion, network connectivity and local sharing for its offloading decisions. We evaluate the results of the scheme via comparison with two validated benchmarks. The outcome highlights a significant improvement in overall system performance due to joint involvement of motion (path planning), connectivity (bandwidth estimation) and robot–robot communication (local offloading) that facilitates energy-efficient offloading to cloud, faster completion of tasks and better utilization of available resources.",

Human's vertical lifting force, comprises of inertial force and gravitational force, was considered as the desired dynamics of the robot system. We hypothesized that human's perception of object weight due to inertial force might be different from the perceived weight due to gravitational force for lifting object with the power assist robot system. We then simulated the system using MATLAB/SIMULINK and lifted different sizes of objects with the system. We analyzed human's perceived weights as well as load force characteristics for lifting objects with the system. The analyses show that human's perception of object weight is related to load force rates instead of load force magnitudes. The analyses clarify that the magnitude of the peak load force is to be optimized in order to optimize the motion of the power assist robot. On the other hand, load force rate is to be optimized in order to optimize the feeling of heaviness of object manipulated with the power assist robot. The results also introduce the technique of simultaneous optimization of motion and perceived heaviness. Finally, we proposed using the findings to design human-friendly power assist robots for carrying heavy objects in various industries.",

Adaptive model predictive control provides a framework to solve optimal discrete control problem for a nonlinear system under input saturation and state constraints. The optimal reference trajectory is computed by using Quasi-linearization (QL) approach to minimize the energy consumption for underactuated motion between two points. The challenge is to meet the performance requirements e.g. position accuracy, repeatability, and precision, combined with high speed capability. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the control scheme.

		"abstract": "Multi-robot systems are getting more popular in the area of robotics. Multi-robot systems are more likely to accomplish complicated tasks while providing efficiency and reliability compared to a single robot. Conserving energy of the robots is also important so that the robots could accomplish more tasks with the constraint of the battery capacity. Research of robotics allow one to realise that some human functions can be applied to a robot. An example would be a person walking along a path. It is an involuntary reaction that a person aim to walk anywhere along the path as long as one stay on the path. It could be seen that the goal position is actually a region instead of a specific point. In addition, one would use his eyes to look for any incoming object to change his path direction to avoid collision. These could all be applied on the robots where the robots would run in a region and using sensors to avoid collision when running in a group. The robots are set to run with conventional trajectory and region trajectory. Conventional trajectory is a traditional method for the robot to the goal position by going to a specific point. Region trajectory control can be visualised as robot travelling within a defined playing field. The robot can travel anywhere within the defined region. The author also set different robot formation to run within the designated region. In order to for multi-robots to run in an orderly manner, a certain pattern need to be considered. In this project, it is required to find out if the robot formation is a factor for energy consumption. This project focus on power consumption of the robots. As the robots are battery-powered, energy measurements would be taken using a power analyser while running the trajectories. Energy consumption will be calculated with the current and voltage values from the power analyser. Energy comparison will be make for different robot formations for different trajectories. There are some constraints faced due to the nature of the robot and the software thus it is necessary to maximize the utility of the robot to meet the goals and also to save on power consumption.In conclusion, a multi-robot system is particularly useful for completing tasks without much supervision. More power-saving controllers could be researched and developed to allow robots to run for a longer time.",

The power of the mobile robot can provide a few hours of peak usage before the power is lack. So the power detection function is an important issue in the autonomous mobile robot. In the paper, we want to design a power detection and diagnosis modular to measure the power condition for the mobile robot. First, we use four current sensors to measure the power variety of the mobile robot. We use redundant management method to detect and diagnosis current sensor status, and isolate faulty sensor to improve the power status to be exact. Then, we use computer simulation to implement the proposed method to be adequate. We design the power detection and diagnosis modular using HOLTEK microchip. The modular select maximum and minimum current value and detection range, and transmits the detection status to the main controller (industry personal computer, IPC) of the mobile robot using series interface. Finally, we implement some experimental scenario using the modular in the mobile robot, and can take some nice results for some variety condition.",

		"abstract": "We proposed a lower extremity exoskeleton for power amplification that perceives intended human motion via humanexoskeleton interaction signals measured by biomedical or mechanical sensors, and estimates human gait trajectories to implement corresponding actions quickly and accurately. In this study, torque sensors mounted on the exoskeleton links are proposed for obtaining physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) torque information directly. A Kalman smoother is adopted for eliminating noise and smoothing the signal data. Simultaneously, the mapping from the pHRI torque to the human gait trajectory is defined. The mapping is derived from the real-time state of the robotic exoskeleton during movement. The walking phase is identified by the threshold approach using ground reaction force. Based on phase identification, the human gait can be estimated by applying the proposed algorithm, and then the gait is regarded as the reference input for the controller. A proportional-integral-derivative control strategy is constructed to drive the robotic exoskeleton to follow the human gait trajectory. Experiments were performed on a human subject who walked on the floor at a natural speed wearing the robotic exoskeleton. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

		"abstract": "Energy management is one of the main hurdles in the quest for autonomous and reliable sensor networks. We present a cluster-based model for energy management in networks with static sensors and mobile robots that act as maintenance entities. The objective is to increase network availability by recharging, replacing or redeploying ”depleted” sensors with the help of mobile robots. The problem is to find a network partition where (1) workload is balanced (i.e. an equipartition) and (2) the movements of the maintenance robots in their partition is minimized. This should be done efficiently at least for the weakest elements of the system, the sensors; that is (3) the number of sensor communications should be kept small. While finding the optimal partition is a NP-hard problem, we show a simple and efficient distributed solution that provides partitions of remarkable quality. The simulation results show a rapid progression towards convergence with the quality of the partition similar to a centralized clustering benchmark (K-means). The analysis of our solutions also shows that sensor message cost remains constant as the size of the network increases.",

		"abstract": "Optimization of full-scale processes during regular production is a challenge that is often encountered in practice, requiring specialized approaches that only introduce small perturbations so that production does not need to be interrupted. Based on a case study, we discuss the potential of Evolutionary Operation (EVOP) derived methods. The case study relates to a badminton robot that has to perform point-to-point motions during a fixed time interval, based on two operation modes: time-optimal motion, which ensures maximum precision but highest energy consumption, and energy-optimal motion, which decreases the energy consumption, but as a trade-off also lowers the precision. The current standard mode of operation is the energy-optimal mode that is constructed from off-line optimization on simulations. An online EVOP steepest ascent optimization to further reduce the energy consumption by fine-tuning the implemented energy-optimal mode was implemented. The constrained nature of the problem, where energy needs to be minimized subject to a time constraint, was transformed to an unconstrained single-objective optimization using Derringer desirability functions. Two important contributions were made: (i) the online optimization of the energy-optimal motion lowered the energy consumption by 4.7% while keeping the precision constant and (ii) the more stringent time-constraints implemented in desirability functions lead to an operation mode with maximum precision and 51.7% less energy consumption than the current time-optimal motion.

		"abstract": "Regarding the typical operation tasks in high-voltage transmission line environment, in order to effectively eliminate or reduce the disadvantageous effects on the robot operation reliability caused by the close chain internal forces. According to the motion status of manipulator operation, the dual-arm coordination control of the mobile operation robot can be divided into three different modes, which are dual-arm independent operation mode, dual-arm fully constrained mode and dual-arm partially constrained mode. The dynamic model between dual-arm and operation objects for the three different models are established, respectively. The manipulator position and force are set as the control targets, a unified dual-arm coordination controller is designed for the three operation modes. Through the mutual compensation of force error and position error, the close chain internal force can be dynamically allocated in each joints, so that the robot joints force can be balanced during the operation, and the internal force in the close chain can be minimized during the operation process so as to ensure the operation reliability and safety. Finally, the validity and engineering practicability is verified by MATLAB simulation experiment and 220 kV living damper replacement and drainage plate bolt tightening operation experiment, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Due to their high power output and reliability, robots can replace humans in most modern industrial tasks associated with heavy loads. However, there are some jobs that require both human flexibility and robot power. Consequently, there is a demand to combine the high power of a robot arm with the dexterity of a human. In this work, a robot system called the power assistant robot (PAR) is proposed to satisfy this demand. The system can be applied not only in heavy industrial tasks, but also in various fields such as rehabilitation, the military, and security. This research focuses on applying a new type of actuator, called an electro-hydraulic system (EHA), in a power assistant robot. The EHA-PAR includes 5 degrees of freedom (1 passive joint and 4 active joints) and interacts with the user through a 4-dimensional intelligent joystick. By analyzing commands from a human, the human-robot interface distributes reference angles for all active joints. However, in some positions, robot operation is suffered from singularity phenomenon; thus it affect to the control quality. This paper proposes a strategy for this problem by combining the Grey predictor and the conventional kinematic solving method. It can be realized that the performance of the system is ameliorated by applying the proposed method.",

With the proposed approach, three joints of the stance legs are active and the fourth leg is passive. A planar kinematic model of the supporting phase is built and the calculated positions and posture of the torso are used as feedback for motion control. The forces and torque acting at the CoM of the robot torso in the plane are fully controllable and decoupled with the control approach based on a virtual model. The planar motions on three axes are controlled independently. For the hopping control, the total energy in a hopping cycle on the vertical direction is planned according to the desired hopping height of the torso's CoM and the virtual vertical stiffness of the torso is generated using the elastic potential energy of the virtual model. We verify the approach and its robustness using simulation experiments and show the results at the end of this paper.",

The five revolute joints are arranged in the configuration of Roll-Pitch-Pitch-Pitch-Roll (abbreviated as RPPPR structure).

		"abstract": "In the first step, a one degree of freedom power assist robotic system is developed for lifting lightweight objects. Dynamics for human–robot co-manipulation is derived that includes human cognition, for example, weight perception. A novel admittance control scheme is derived using the weight perception–based dynamics. Human subjects lift a small-sized, lightweight object with the power assist robotic system. Human–robot interaction and system characteristics are analyzed. A comprehensive scheme is developed to evaluate the human–robot interaction and performance, and a constrained optimization algorithm is developed to determine the optimum human–robot interaction and performance. The results show that the inclusion of weight perception in the control helps achieve optimum human–robot interaction and performance for a set of hard constraints. In the second step, the same optimization algorithm and control scheme are used for lifting a heavy object with a multi-degree of freedom power assist robotic system. The results show that the human–robot interaction and performance for lifting the heavy object are not as good as that for lifting the lightweight object. Then, weight perception–based intelligent controls in the forms of model predictive control and vision-based variable admittance control are applied for lifting the heavy object. The results show that the intelligent controls enhance human–robot interaction and performance, help achieve optimum human–robot interaction and performance for a set of soft constraints, and produce similar human–robot interaction and performance as obtained for lifting the lightweight object. The human–robot interaction and performance for lifting the heavy object with power assist are treated as intuitive and natural because these are calibrated with those for lifting the lightweight object. The results also show that the variable admittance control outperforms the model predictive control. We also propose a method to adjust the variable admittance control for three degrees of freedom translational manipulation of heavy objects based on human intent recognition. The results are useful for developing controls of human friendly, high performance power assist robotic systems for heavy object manipulation in industries.",

		"abstract": "Legged walking robots have very strong operation ability in the complex surface and they are very suitable for transportation of tools, materials, and equipment in unstructured environment. Aiming at the problems of energy consumption of legged transport robot during the fast moving, a method of galloping trajectory planning based on energy consumption optimization is proposed. By establishing transition angle polynomials of flight phase, lift-off phase, and stance phase and constraint condition between each state phase, the locomotion equations of the ellipse trajectory are derived. The transition angle of each state phase is introduced into the system energy consumption equations, and the energy optimization index based on transition angles is established. Inverse kinematics solution and trajectory planning in one gait cycle are applied to genetic algorithm process to solve the nonlinear programming problem. The results show that the optimized distribution of transition angles of state phases is more reasonable, and joint torques and system energy consumption are reduced effectively. Thus, the method mentioned above has a great significance to realize fast operation outdoors of transport robot.",

The vision system has been studied for use in observing surface information about electric parts (dry batteries), inspecting them and then placing good ones into a given box. Three major robot vision functions are implemented here: object recognition, inspection and position determination by binary and gray-scale image processing techniques. While binary image techniques are used in battery terminal inspection and box position determination gray-scale image processing functions are performed in a label pattern check on a battery surface, front or rear surface determination, and surface defect inspection.",

		"abstract": "In this article, we have designed and implemented a Type-1 Fuzzy Pulse Width Modulation (TFPWM) controller, which can autonomously control the motion, direction, and orientation of the differential drive 4-wheeled power robot in any working environment. This proposed TFPWM controller has three inputs (obstacle distances) and four outputs (motor PWM controlled velocities). The controller collects input data from the group of sensors (ultrasonic and infrared) and generates pulse width modulation (PWM) based velocity control command to all four motors of 4-wheeled power robot using if-then fuzzy rule-based model. This TFPWM controller helped the robot to avoid obstacles autonomously during navigation. Computer simulation results have done through the graphical user interface (GUI) platform of MATLAB software. Successful navigation results of differential drive 4-wheeled power robot in computer simulations verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed controller. We have compared this TFPWM controller based simulation results with existing techniques and found better results in terms of simulation path length.",

The tasks that the robot performs can be either autonomous or remotely operated.

As an example, we direct to do the work instructions such as “Tightening a mechanical nut onto a mechanical bolt”, then our robot autonomously carries out the work. Work that cannot be done autonomous is remotely operated using the master arm joystick. This report relates to the HRI (Human Robot Interface) for remote operation with a master arm joystick, and the GUI (Graphical User Interface). In order to easily perform the operations, the operation arm, vehicle tool (gripper, impact wrench) with force feedback master arm, and the camera are all devices to be operated at the same time with the joystick. In addition, in that paper we perform some tasks as experiments like tightening of the nut, and we evaluate the HRI.",

The traditional servo valve control system possesses good position control ability, but it has the problem of bilateral throttling loss and great valve port pressure decrease. This paper proposes a hydraulic position control system based on high-frequency switching valve, which controls valve port opening and closing, through the PWM signals, so as to control flows, guarantee the position control precision as well as reduce the required system pressure, thereby achieving the effect of energy conservation.

Wireless technology, which is widely used not only in close range but also in long range, is a technique which uses electronic components that can interface to the other devices. In this work, the energy sensors, such as voltage and current analogue sensors are connected to the XBee RF module directly to reduce the power consumption and the complexity. The wireless XBee RF module together with the sensors were utilized in such a way that direct coupling and data processing have been used to send the energy values wirelessly for monitoring or managing station which may be considered as a computer. A significant clear signals for the current and voltage rates were harvested from the developed circuits and to compare with the direct oscilloscope measuring method. The suitable setting up of the components selection and configuration were the main reason for this method to success. The contribution of this proposed method is the utilizing of the XBee built-in microcontroller at the remote and base XBee’s modes to dispense about any other microcontroller or extra components.",

Four walking gaits, covering the situation of humanoid robot walking are selected to compare their motion energy. After sorting the walking gait of wasting least motion energy based on experiments, we focus on the study of motion energy influenced by walking gait parameters including pace length, pace height and body location. In addition, a proper experiment is designed to study the energy wasted by humanoid robot join friction.

This paper presents the dynamic design on portable, light and faster aluminum-based robot for safe, cost-effective and reliable inspection of power lines. Unlike the existing robots which are slow and heavy, the proposed two arm aluminum 6061 based robot designed using SOLIDWORKS is fast, portable and inexpensive. The designed concept has been actualized into a real lab-scale robot. To investigate the dynamic behavior of the robot, the mechanical properties of the robot were used to represent the system in a mass-spring-damper configuration. The Lagrange’s equation was used to derive the mathematical equations of the robot. In addition, MATLAB was utilized for the simulation analysis of the robot under different operating conditions. Finally, a bang-bang input was used to drive the robot along the power line in real-time. The simulations and experimental results show that the designed climbsliding robot has been successfully implemented and can be used for power line inspection.",

In a general automatic reading system, there are many limitations to the reading correctness and system robustness such as the high cost for the reason that there is only one instrument could be monitored by a single system, the strict restrict of the camera angle, and being not suitable for instruments with dense scales and so on. We present some solutions to overcome these limitations. Firstly, we combine a mobile inspection robot with an image capture device and the image processing method to cut the cost of the monitoring of analog instruments in power plants. Then, we use Hough transform and perspective transform to correct the geometric distortion of images caused by camera angle. Eventually, we get the result of dense scaled instruments based on polar transform. Experiments show that our system performs quite well, and the reading error is less than the results which obtained from the general automatic reading system.",

In this paper, we describe problems and solutions encountered while de- signing an infrared-based communication device for the mini robot Khepera. In contrast to traditional omnidirectional systems, it features directed, power-variable transmission in eight directions at 23.4 kbps up to a range of 1m . It can differentiate incoming data sig- nals from interference from adjacent sectors and can estimate their direction-of-arrival. We model the transmission over the infrared channel and show how interference influences the reception of the data signals. We also describe methods how to reduce these effects. We have tested the performance of the resulted signal processing in a worst case scenario by simulations and in experiments with a prototype implementation. The resulted module is especially suited for experimental evaluation of ad hoc network protocols and for position estimation.",

The criterion is proposed based on the knowledge of the energy consumption of the studied robot to negotiate stairs of varying heights in the walking locomotion mode.",

The solar array converts the solar power into electrical energy and this energy is used to drive the actuators so that the wires are avoided as in the case of a conventional power supply. A small 3-axes arm is also mounted on the mobile trolley which is used to do some mundane pick and place operations. Also a ultrasonic sensing system is designed and used which is used to avoid the obstacles in its path of motion, thus making the system more intelligent. The generated solar voltage from the solar cells is thus an add-on feature.",

Monitoring of Citarum River water quality is essential because it is to know its condition. Despite that, regular monitoring requires water samples to be taken to the laboratory to be tested. Therefore it is not real-time and wasteful of energy. In this paper, a design of IoT-based river water quality monitoring-system using LPWAN communication technology will be proposed so that monitoring points on the Citarum watershed can be monitored in real-time and the results of monitoring data will be stored in the server for data logging. A test about communication range is performed with four nodes and one gateway with LoRa transceiver paired with Arduino boards, as LPWAN communication method, to be able to exchange information in terms of hardware and implement network mesh topologies to widen monitoring points in terms of software. It is shown from the test result that the communication range for the transmission between node to node or node to gateway reaches a maximum of 500 m close on the surface of the water.",

		"abstract": "Main advantage of redundant space manipulator is that it can be configured differently by actuating various joints. Space manipulators are designed to be deployed in harsh surroundings, which in turn would increase the possibility of manipulator failure. Thus, the enhancement of the capabilities of the robots and the failures thereafter are a major concern. This article presents three aspects of hyper-redundant space robot. First, the control strategies based on minimum power criterion with all healthy joints are proposed. Second, hyper-redundancy is put upon to reconfigure the space robot with the failure of locked joints. Third, the optimization of workplace trajectory of the manipulator is obtained by genetic algorithm and a minimum power criterion has been adopted in all three cases. The bond-graph technique is employed for robot modeling with the use of SYMBOLS Shakti software, which generates system equations in C++ code. This code is subsequently converted into a MATLAB program. The result obtained through simulation shows that 37% of the total power consumption was reduced by the actuators through an optimization approach.",

		"abstract": "The smallest charging times required by fully discharged conventional batteries are some tens of minutes. This is an important limitation for mobile robot platforms. A previous paper already validated the possibility of integrating ultracapacitors and batteries in the same system. However, it has some significant limitations: 1) It works with an ultracapacitors module or a battery, but it does not work with both devices at the same time; 2) It requires an external dedicated charging station; 3) It is not possible to take profit from a part - which is non-negligible - of the energy previously stored in the ultracapacitors. This paper presents a new power supply system for mobile robot platforms that has been developed in order to overcome these limitations. Its main goals are evaluating the feasibility of: 1) Fully integrating batteries and ultracapacitors, working simultaneously as energy-storing devices, with the aim of enabling a mobile robot platform to achieve a reasonable autonomy after a very reduced charging time and considerable autonomy when there are no charging time constraints; 2) Installing all the system in the mobile robot platform, avoiding the use of an external dedicated charging station; 3) Extracting almost all the energy previously stored in the ultracapacitors. Both simulation results and experimental results are presented.",

		"abstract": "This paper deals with the development of a dynamical model related to crab walking of a hexapod robot to determine the feet forces' distributions, energy consumption and dynamic stability measure considering the inertial effects of the legs on the system, which has not been attempted before. Both forward and inverse kinematic analyses of the robot are carried out with an assigned fixed global frame and subsequent local frames in the trunk body and joints of each leg. Coupled multi-body dynamic model of the robot is developed based on free-body diagram approach. Optimal feet forces and corresponding joint torques on all the legs are determined based on the minimization of the sum of the squares of joint torques, using quadratic programming (QP) method. An energy consumption model is developed to determine the minimum energy required for optimal values of feet forces. To ensure dynamically stable gaits, dynamic gait stability margin (DGSM) is determined from the angular momentum of the system about the supporting edges. Computer simulations have been carried out to test the effectiveness of the developed dynamic model with crab wave gaits on a banking surface. It is observed that when the swing leg touches the ground, impact forces (sudden shoot outs) are generated and their effects are also observed on the joints of the legs. The effects of walking parameters, namely trunk body velocity, body stroke, leg offset, body height, crab angle etc. on power consumption and stability during crab motion for duty factors (DFs) like 1/2, 2/3, 3/4 have also been studied.",

Since it mimics the behaviors of social insects, it is critical to program artificial swarm intelligence in a versatile manner. Distributed, scalable and severely resource-limited nature of swarm robotics, however, makes it very difficult to write application programs. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use and effective programming model that addresses such programming difficulties as well as the energy-efficient deployment and execution of swarm intelligence programs. Specifically, the proposed model lets programmers concentrate on writing a core swarm intelligence algorithm while abstracting the implementation issues such as communication, synchronization and parallel processing of the algorithms. In order to show the utility and viability of the proposed approach, we have demonstrated a 3D map building application and performed experiments. The results show that the proposed approach reduces data traffic up to 82% with an acceptable error.",

		"abstract": "This paper proposes an obstacle avoidance method for navigation of a mobile robot in uncertain environments based on a novel neural learning algorithm, namely least mean p-norm extreme learning machine (LMP-ELM) and Q-learning. The proposed obstacle avoidance method comprises of two behavior modules, Viz., an avoidance behavior and goal-seeking behavior. At the learning phase, the two modules are independently designed using the proposed LMP-ELM and Q-Learning. And then they are combined to navigate the mobile to the goal position without colliding with obstacles based on a switching function at the running phase. The LMP-ELM is used to realize the state-action mapping of the Q-learning. In the novel LMP-ELM, the computationally simple extreme learning machine architecture is maintained but a novel error criterion, namely the least mean p-power (LMP) error criterion provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially. The LMP error criterion aims to minimize the mean p-power of the error that is the generalization of the mean square error criterion used in the ELM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations.",

Power Press is the machine which is useful to punch the metal disc of various size in various design according to requirement. We use the separation mechanism to separate the disc at the input side. This mechanism will also place the disc in the power press. For separation mechanism we use electrical system which guides the slider movement with the help of DC motor. Power press processes on disc as per requirement and then robotic arm will pick up the punched disc and stack it. Electromagnets are used in this Robotic arm to attract the punched disc and place it at the collecting point. Robotic Arm also comprises of H-Bridge Circuitry which would help it to move in Forward & Reverse direction. Limit Switches are used to stop the arm at specific position. We also use proximity sensor to sense the presence of disc at the input side. We use IR Sensor for detection of motion of separation mechanism. We have also used Relays to switch from one voltage level to another voltage level. If there will be an error in system, then buzzer will sound and LED will flash to attract the attention of the operator. The complete Synchronization and controlling of the system will be done by PLC.",

		"abstract": "In industry there is a constant need to make solutions that are more efficient, reduces risk and reduces the impact on the environment. In order to achieve this we see a rapid increase in use of automatic production. Automation of industrial processes typically uses robot manipulators in operations such as drilling, welding, painting, laser cutting or assembly. In the pursuit of improved performance from industrial robot manipulators we see an increasing interest in development of optimal motion on different performance indexes such as velocity, accuracy or energy efficiency. This paper concerns energy efficient scenarios where even minor improvements in performance can lead to substantial impacts on both energy use and profit.\n\nThis master thesis includes development of a mathematical model for industrial robot manipulator IRB 1600, by ABB. This includes estimation of masses, centers of mass and inertias. Using a Nikon Metrology camera measurement system the dynamic friction of the robot is characterized, and repeated experiments indicate that friction compensation using this characterization improves performance of the robot in terms of accuracy by 25- 50% for joint 1 thru 3 for different scenarios.\n\nFurther, a scheme for development of optimal motion profiles is made, in terms of minimizing mechanical energy consumed by the robot. The motion profiles are made to follow a predefined path, and are derived through numerical optimization. Repeated experiments are performed using an inverse dynamics PD+ controller. By comparing the performance of the robot manipulator to trajectories developed using the standard motion planner (RobotStudio/Rapid), a decrease of about 7% in consumed energy is obtained.",

		"abstract": "This paper focuses on the design and construction of anoptimization charging system for batteries by means of tracked solar panels. Thus, the implementation of a complete energy management system applied to a robotic exploration vehicle is put forward. The proposed system was tested on the robotic platform—an autonomous unmanned exploration vehicle specialized in recognition. The interest of this robotic system lies in the design concept, based on a smart microcontroller. On this basis, our proposal makes a twofold significant contribution. On the one hand, it presents the construction of a solar tracking mechanism aimed at increasing the rover’s power regardless of its mobility. On the other hand, it proposes an alternative design of power system performance based on a pack of two batteries. The aim is completing the process of charging a battery independently while the other battery provides all the energy consumed by the robotic vehicle. In this the ARM interfaces with LDRS, DC motors, wireless module, battery switching circuit and monitor circuit. LDR is used to calculate light intensity and based on this the controller changes the solar panel direction using DC motor. And another two DC motors acts as robot and this robot can be controlled through wireless network. The solar panel takes the complete solar energy and that can be stored in battery and one more battery to run the DC motors of robot. Whenever the power consumed completely in one battery then switch to another one using switching circuit. The batteries can monitor through battery monitor circuit. Wireless camera is also used to capture the pictures around.",

The control algorithm for active exercise and the integration of the related software and hardware are also developed to offer proper environment for a game session. The derivation of the mechanical power of a human subject in the training is verified with active and passive cycling exercises. Three healthy subjects participate in the game sessions provided by the robot. It is found that the game sessions can provide the movement training with sufficient intensity. Moreover, the mechanical power obtained from the proposed method is able to identify the intensity of training tasks, human performance, and human attention in the training.",

Before that, this method only includes equality state constraint, but in this paper, also includes inequality state constraint to restrict the range of joint angle. In addition, we performed the walking experiment to verify the effectiveness of this method. We realized the stable walking of 0.6 s period and 0.3 m/s.

The configuration of the single legs composed of a body module, a thigh module, a shank module, an ankle module and an energy storage unit. An energy storage unit is designed at each joint. The energy storage unit is driven by a servo motor, and servo motor drives a guide rod to compress a spring for energy storage, which can quickly release energy according to the action requirement to rapidly change motion state of the connected structure for realizing the jump of the single leg. In order to realize the simulation analysis of the robot motion, the single leg model was built using Solidworks software and the model was imported into ADAMS software for dynamic simulation. In the ADAMS software, the jumping ability of the robot is realized by motion planning, giving joint’s driving functions and the foot trajectory function. The contact force curve and the corresponding motion parameters are obtained between the foot point and the ground at the moment of take-off and landing. The work provides a theoretical support for the optimal design and practical use of the robot’s single leg.",

Ratio change of current transformer is introduced by which the secondary current could be adaptive to the bus current.

A novel approach for tracking and identification of robots using 1D barcodes is proposed.

The central server can turn on/off processing on either node based on the received information. Furthermore, a novel LoRa-based low-power communication protocol is designed to provide the necessary bandwidth. The proposed system yields optimized node energy consumption, which we model mathematically and compare against the energy consumption of a system of independent cameras.

In this paper, the energy consumptions of the quadruped robot SCalf with a trot gait under different gait parameters are analyzed. Firstly, the kinematics and dynamics models of the robot are established. Then, an energy model including the mechanical power and heat rate is proposed. To obtain the energy consumption, a cubic spline interpolation foot trajectory is used, and the feet forces are calculated by using the minimization of norm of the foot force method. Moreover, an energetic criterion measuring the energy cost is defined to evaluate the motion. Finally, the gait parameters such as step height, step length, standing height, gait cycle, and duty cycle that influence the energy consumption are studied, which could provide a theoretical basis for parameter optimization and motion control of quadruped robots.",

The target area is defined as a frontier which represents the limit between an unknown and explored part of the environment. Thus, each robot from the team is assigned to the frontier for which it has the lowest rank among the other robots in term of energy consumption. An implementation and tests in computerized simulation as well as a comparison with some existing approaches has been performed. The results obtained demonstrate the validity and the efficiency of our method.",

A popular hypothesis regarding legged locomotion is that humans and other large animals walk and run in a manner that minimizes the metabolic energy expenditure for locomotion. Here, a mathematical model for a simple two-dimensional planar kneed walker with point feet and two bended knees is discussed. An energy-effective gait is designed by using piecewise torque method. Then, the robot model can exhibit a natural and reasonable walk on a level ground. The results can prove that the proposed optimal energy-effective gait is suitable for this kneed biped walking robot.

		"abstract": "This paper studies a reliable control strategy for a bionic-ape brachiation robot with dual-arm hands, a four-link brachiate mechanism, which swings and grasps branches like a gibbon. Based on the analysis of the brachiation of gibbons and humans, the big damping nonholonomic constraints model is introduced. A control strategy which combines the energy pumping control with the big damping turn-back angle feedback control is proposed. The grasping motion was divided into several processes: the swing-up self-starting phase, the energy rising phase, the transition phase and the grasping phase. A self-starting controller is designed for swing-up motion from a downward stable position. In the energy rising phase, an energy pumping control law is deduced based on Lyapunov stability theory, and the singularity and convergence of the system are analyzed. The system energy is calculated periodically to determine if the robot gets enough energy for grasping, so that it could shift into the transition phase. A position–orientation control method is adopted to realize that the gripper grasps target bars in the desired position, orientation and speed. By means of ADAMS-MATLAB co-simulation, the bionic-ape robot achieves smooth swing-grasp motions under different heights and horizontal distances. The simulation results indicate that this method has advantages of universality and reliability in a grasping target bar. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated.",

		"abstract": "Abstract—the majority of today’s mobile robots are very dependent on battery power. Mobile robots can operate untethered for a number of hours but eventually they will need to recharge their batteries in-order to continue to function. While computer processing and sensors have become cheaper and more powerful each year, battery development has progress very little. They are slow to re-charge, inefficient and lagging behind in the general progression of robotic development we see today. However, batteries are relatively cheap and when fully charged, can supply high power output necessary for operating heavy mobile robots. As there are no cheap alternatives to batteries, we need to find efficient ways to manage the power that batteries provide during their operational lifetime. This paper proposes the use of autonomic principles of self-adaption to address the behavioral changes a battery experiences as it gets older. In life, as we get older, we cannot perform tasks in the same way as we did in our youth; these tasks generally take longer to perform and require more of our energy to complete. Batteries also suffer from a form of degradation. As a battery gets older, it loses the ability to retain the same charge capacity it would have when brand new. This paper investigates how we can adapt the current state of a battery charge and cycle count, to the requirements of a mobile robot to perform its tasks.",

It states that robot's rich dynamics can be exploited to generate desirable behaviors, which can be altered when their morphology is adapted accordingly. This paper presents a low-cost robot made of elastic curved beam driven by a motor, with morphological computation and adaptation ability. Simply by changing robot's shape and the rotating frequency of the motor that vibrates the robot's body, the robot is able to shift its behavior from showing a tendency to slide when it needs to perform tasks like going under confined space, to have more tendency to hop diagonally forward when the robot stands upright. It will also be shown that based on the proposed mechanism, the energy efficiency of the robot locomotion can be maximized.",

		"abstract": "In this work a method for trajectory planning based on time-energy optimization of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot is proposed. The method utilizes a nonlinear variable change that transforms the nonlinear optimization problem into a discrete second order cone programming that can be solved by convex optimization tools. The formulation of the multiobjective function has two components: the total energy and the traversal time that is weighted by a parameter named penalty coefficient. With the use of the penalty coefficient one can establish a trade-off between the optimization of the total energy and the traversal time. The relation between both objectives draws a Pareto Front in the criterion space parameterized by the penalty coefficient. The rationale of this paper is to assume that the Pareto curve is an exponential function, and to propose an algorithm to estimate its parameters. Using this exponential function it is possible to estimate the Knee Point that is an optimal solution that balances time and energy equally. This systematic approach might be understood as a self-tuning algorithm that estimate the penalty coefficient for the generation of optimal voltage signals. Numerical results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.",

		"abstract": "The inspection of power lines and associated hardware is vital to ensuring the reliability of the transmission and distribution network. The repetitive nature of the inspection tasks present a unique opportunity for the introduction of robotic platforms, which offer the ability to perform more systematic and detailed inspection than traditional methods. This lends itself to improved asset management automation, cost-effectiveness and safety for the operating crew.  This dissertation presents the development of a prototype industrial brachiating robot. The robot is mechanically simple and capable of dynamically negotiating obstacles by brachiating. This is an improvement over current robotic platforms, which employ slow, high power static schemes for obstacle negotiation.  Mathematical models of the robot were derived to understand the underlying dynamics of the system. These models were then used in the generation of optimal trajectories, using nonlinear optimisation techniques, for brachiating past line hardware.  A physical robot was designed and manufactured to validate the brachiation manoeuvre. The robot was designed following classic mechanical design principles, with emphasis on functional design and robustness.  System identification was used to capture the plant uncertainty and a feedback controller was designed to track the reference trajectory allowing for energy optimal brachiation swings.  Finally, the robot was tested, starting with sub-system testing and ending with testing of a brachiation manoeuvre proving the prospective viability of the robot in an industrial environment.",

		"abstract": "Today the HRI community generates a lot of knowledge on how one robot affects one\r\nhuman, and how one robot affects multiple human listeners. Much less knowledge is\r\navailable on how robots affect the human language and how this language change can\r\naffect human attitudes and behaviours. This language effect is of particular interest for\r\nwhen we get into a situation where a major part of the human population has robots, as\r\nwe are now experiencing with the ubiquity of smartphones. In this case, the questions\r\nare: What happens if all robots were to use the same words? For example, when they all\r\nuse the same source as their dictionary. Will robots be able to affect the word choices of\r\nthe human population, and what are the implications of connotation-laden vocabulary?\r\nEven more interesting, will this word choice affect the attitudes and behaviours of the\r\nhuman population?\r\n\r\nThrough all those questions a central question for this thesis emerged: \"Are Robots\r\nable to influence a group of people via the usage of language?\" To find out if this might\r\nbe possible, we developed three connected experiments. In the first, the effect of peer\r\npressure on humans created by robots is explored, focusing on how this peer pressure\r\naffects the language of a person. To see if and how this influence of robots works, the\r\neffect of the robots was compared against that of human actors. The results of the ex-\r\nperiment showed that the actors could indeed influence the participants as predicted,\r\nhowever, no such influence could be shown by the robots. It was concluded that the\r\nreason the robots did not affect the humans was that the participants did not feel that\r\nthey belonged to the robots group.\r\n\r\nIn the second experiment, a robot and human group setting was created. In this\r\nexperiment, the robot tried to influence the human language. Important here to mention\r\nis that the experiment measured if the language of participants was affected by the robot\r\ninfluence, even after the interaction and without any robot in the room. It was also mea-\r\nsured if the word chosen by the robot had an influence on how a person would perceive\r\nthe discussed object. The outcome of the experiment was successful, and showed that\r\nthe group building worked and the robot was able to affect the human language, even\r\nafter the interaction was over. It further showed that robots were able to affect the hu-\r\nmans attitude toward objects simply by using positive or negative connoted synonyms\r\nfor a particular object.\r\n\r\nIn the third and last experiment, the question was: Can many robots affect the\r\nlanguage of a whole human population? To answer this, different parameters were measured:\r\nHow many humans need robots so that the robots could manipulate the whole\r\nhuman populations language? And does it matter which persons in the human population\r\nwill get a robot - whether it be a person who is very well connected or a person\r\nwho is poorly connected, for example? Since we are currently not in a time where a\r\nhuge number of people actually have robots, a simulation was created. The outcome of\r\nthe simulation was that on average only 11% of the human population needed robots to\r\naffect the language of 95% of the human population.\r\n\r\nFinally, to further deepen the knowledge on how simple language change can affect\r\nhuman attitude and behaviour a literature review is added. This review focuses\r\nparticularly on persuasion via language, which includes effects like gender neutral versus\r\nnon-gender neutral language.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this thesis is that in certain situations, a group of robots is able\r\nto affect the language, and in turn the behavioural responses, of the majority of the\r\nhuman population.",

In previous studies, the dynamical model of the continuum robot is constructed by using the Lagrange method and the analytic method for the kinematics and dynamics of a continuum robot are shown. In this paper, we focus on the development of the kinematic models of the continuum robot and the energy optimal planning for the continuum robot. A multilayer neural network is used for solving the non-linearity of the rigid parallel mechanism. Based on Bishop frames, an optimal curve is used to generate the continuous backbone curve. The optimality criteria are used to choose the curve that satisfies task constraints while optimizing energy consumption.

		"abstract": "The efficiency of energy usage applied to robots that implement autonomous duties such as floor cleaning depends crucially on the adopted path planning strategies. Energy-aware for complete coverage path planning (CCPP) in the reconfigurable robots raises interesting research, since the ability to change the robot&rsquo;s shape needs the dynamic estimate energy model. In this paper, a CCPP for a predefined workspace by a new floor cleaning platform (hTetro) which can self-reconfigure among seven tetromino shape by the cooperation of hinge-based four blocks with independent differential drive modules is proposed. To this end, the energy consumption is represented by travel distances which consider operations of differential drive modules of the hTetro kinematic designs to fulfill the transformation, orientation correction and translation actions during robot navigation processes from source waypoint to destination waypoint. The optimal trajectory connecting all pairs of waypoints on the workspace is modeled and solved by evolutionary algorithms of TSP such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Optimization Colony (AC) which are among the well-known optimization approaches of TSP. The evaluations across several conventional complete coverage algorithms to prove that TSP-based proposed method is a practical energy-aware navigation sequencing strategy that can be implemented to our hTetro robot in different real-time workspaces. Moreover, The CCPP framework with its modulation in this paper allows the convenient implementation on other polynomial-based reconfigurable robots.",

The green state has very low strength and high brittleness where the forces applied during machining can generate and/or develop defects in the part that will reduce their properties after sintering. This work aims to study the machining by robot models of electrical insulators in 1:10 scale. Blanks were compacted in high alumina porcelain by isostatic pressing and green machined with a manual grinder attached to a Kuka KR16 robot. Models of insulators in gypsum were successfully machined and used for setup and configuration of the process. They were machined with cutting depth 0.87 mm and feed of 20 mm/s, this is the minimum programmable velocity for this robot model, and these parameters for the machining of the green porcelain generated excessive cracks at the tips of the fins. Changing the cutting depth to values of 0.25 mm, an established value in CNC machining, allowed to conclude that insufficient stiffness of the robot together with its high forward speed and excessive vibration of the grinding limits its use for thin thicknesses, although with potential for improvement.",

This method basically exploits a power consumption model of the robot which is obtained from the following two phases: first, the values of the robot power consumption in different slope angle, robot velocity, and robot heading angle are numerically calculated using a dynamic simulation of the robot taking into account of an accurate wheel-soil interaction mechanics; and subsequently, an approximated model for the robot power consumption is elaborated by neural network. Using the power consumption model an energy-efficient trajectory for a slope traversal case can be generated. Here, a bezier curve is used to provide a smooth trajectory designed with an appropriate arrival time as well as the control points for the curve. The numerical simulation result of the trajectory planning based on the proposed method gives several insights for a feasible trajectory for slope ascending scenario.",

		"abstract": "In nature through millions of years of evolution fish and cetaceans  have developed fast efficient and highly manoeuvrable methods of marine propulsion. \r\n\r\n A recent explosion in demand for sub sea robotics, for conducting tasks such as sub sea exploration and survey has left developers desiring to capture some of the novel mechanisms evolved by fish and cetaceans to increase the efficiency of speed and manoeuvrability of sub sea robots.\r\n \r\n Research has revealed that interactions with vortices and other unsteady fluid effects play a significant role in the efficiency of fish and cetaceans. However attempts to duplicate this with robotic fish have been limited by the difficulty of predicting or sensing such uncertain fluid effects. This study aims to develop a gait generation method for a robotic fish with a degree of passivity which could allow the body to dynamically interact with and potentially synchronise with vortices within the flow without the need to actually sense them.\r\n \r\n In this study this is achieved through the development of a novel energy based gait generation tactic, where the gait of the robotic fish is determined through regulation of the state energy rather than absolute state position.  Rather than treating fluid interactions as undesirable disturbances and  `fighting' them to maintain a rigid geometric defined gait, energy based control allows the disturbances to the system generated by vortices in the surrounding flow to contribute to the energy of the system and hence the dynamic motion.\r\n \r\n Three different energy controllers are presented within this thesis, a deadbeat energy controller equivalent to an analytically optimised model predictive controller, a $H_\\infty$ disturbance rejecting controller with a novel gradient decent optimisation and finally a error feedback controller with a novel alternative error metric. The controllers were tested on a robotic fish simulation platform developed within this project.\r\n \r\n The simulation platform consisted of the solution of a series of ordinary differential equations for solid body dynamics coupled with a finite element incompressible fluid dynamic simulation of the surrounding flow. results demonstrated the effectiveness of the energy based control approach and illustrate the importance of choice of controller in performance.",

Since the power source of this device is on-board batteries the requirement for power consumption is relevant. In the course of the work the analysis of the device processes which shows that a significant current flows in the windings of the motors during the stabilizing system operation is carried out. This is the reason for the high power consumption. In addition this causes the motor windings heating which also has a negative effect on the system operation. Further in the work the factors influencing the power consumption of the device are researched taking into account the features of stabilization system implementation on a microcontroller and the features of the actuators and their control.

A simulation study of the proposed path planning is performed using a dynamics engine which calculates power generation from the SAP and power consumption of the robot while the robot following a given path.

However, the cruising period is conspicuously restrained by the heavy weight and the discharge instability of the existed battery structure. Generally speaking, the state of discharge (SOD) of lithium cells can be satisfied by the series-connected cells with gas-gauge if the discharge current is small enough. The reliable cycle-lifespan would be shortened and significant KPI are no longer assured when the cell-unbalanced phenomenon occurs under the heavy-duty DC discharge conditions. This paper is aimed to develop a power predictable algorithm with inexpensive, lighter-weight, durable, reliable, and intelligent cell-balance circuit (ICBC) to protect the battery management system (BMS).

MRESS is intended to enable a firefighting robot with sub-robots and a fire hose to effectively reach desired destinations while saving battery. To increase operating time by improving the traction efficiency of the firefighting robot, we designed a sub-robot and added it to the firefighting robot. The main goal of the sub-robot is drawing a fire hose in order to save energy consumption of the firefighting robot. For the efficient cooperation, MRESS operates robots with a fire hose by combining a vision-based fire hose tracking method, an endrunning navigation and a limit-cycle navigation applied to the edge of obstacles. The fusion of a limit-cycle navigation and a fire hose tracking method has remarkable advantages such as smooth path planning and fast computational data processing. Further, the endrunning navigation method can decrease the chance of a collision that would possibly twist the fire hoses. As a result, MRESS enables the robots and a fire hose to effectively navigate a smooth planned path with fast processing and to successfully reach the desired destination without twisting the fire hose and wasting energy.",

		"abstract": "In this paper an Energy Dissipation Rate Control (EDRC) method is introduced, which could provide stable walking or running gaits for legged robots. This method is realized by developing a semi-analytical pattern generation approach for a robot during each Single Support Phase (SSP). As yet, several control methods based on passive dynamic walking have been proposed by researchers to provide an efficient human-like biped walking robot. For most of these passive based controllers the main idea is to shape the robot’s energy level during each SSP to restore the mechanical energy which has been lost in the previous Impact Phases (IP); however, the EDRC method provides stable gaits for legged robots just by controlling the robot’s energy level during each IP. In this paper EDRC is applied to a Six-Link Three-Point Foot (6L3PF) model, to realize an active dynamic galloping gait on level ground. As the point-foot contact assumption for the 6L3PF imposes one degree of under-actuation in the ankle joint, it is not clear how to specify the forward kinematic defining the swing leg position and velocity as a function of actuated joint angles. So, a new strategy for solving the dynamic and kinematic equations of the robot is introduced for deriving suitable joint trajectories during each SSP. Simulation results show that the proposed methods in this paper are effective and the robot exhibits a stable dynamic galloping gait on level ground.",

The task is to find the periodic law of motion of the internal mass that minimizes the work of the resistance forces during the period of motion of the system for a fixed period of oscillations and the given average velocity of the shell. The dependence of the optimal modes of the dimensionless oscillation period that characterizes the ratio of Basset forces to viscous forces is investigated.",

In the present research, an approach to obtain the nonlinear dynamics equations of motion of a 3-RRcP spherical parallel manipulator is presented. The proposed approach is based on the principle of virtual power and the screw theory. To obtain the dynamics equations of motion, we propose an influence matrix which relates the passive joint rates to the actuated joint rates for each branch. The presented method allows a straightforward computation of torques of the actuated joints in terms of the resultant external forces and the desired trajectory. In order to represent correctness and accuracy of the obtained equations of motion, two case studies are considered that their solutions are compared by a commercial dynamics software package (CDSP).",

Mobile robotic systems draw power from batteries which have a limited power life. This poses a greater challenge for an autonomous robot. Monitoring the status of the battery power in the robot is therefore important for autonomous robotic systems. Docking and recharging are crucial abilities of autonomous mobile robot to ensure its performance. In this paper, the focus of attention is on the significance of power monitoring for long-term operation of autonomous robots and power estimation and auto-recharging. This paper attempts to brief about a literature review of complete solution for docking methods and recharging the battery of a mobile robot. Major progress is being done on both technology and exploitation of docking mechanism and recharging without any human intervention. This review paper gives the overview of related work in terms of immediate challenges for true energy autonomy in mobile robots with respect to battery technology, power estimation and auto recharging.",

Redundancy is commonly used to increase the workspace and stiffness or to achieve secondary objectives like energetic minimization or additional movements. This article presents a method based on energy distribution to handle the redundancy of cable-driven parallel robots. This method allows the deformation and tension of each link to be related to the total energy available in the parallel robot. The study of energy distribution expression allows deformation, tension, and position to be combined. It also defines the range of tension and deformation that cables can achieve without altering the wrench exerted on the end-effector. This range is used with a passive reconfigurable end-effector to control the position of two grippers attached to some cables which act as compliant actuators. The relationship between the actuators&rsquo; energy and their corresponding gripper positions is also provided. In this way, energy measurement from the actuators allows the grasping state to be sensed. The results are validated using multibody dynamic software.",

		"abstract": "Resumo: Diversos fatores podem impactar a qualidade da distribuição de energia elétrica, entre eles, um dos mais impactantes é o contato de vegetação com linhas aéreas energizadas. Assim sendo, é de suma importância a poda de vegetação próxima à linhas energizadas. Visando-se aprimorar esse processo, pode-se empregar um robô teleoperado de poda, de forma que a poda possa ser realizada de maneira remota e segura. As câmeras instaladas no braço robótico permitem que o operador tenha visão da área de corte mesmo quando a visada direta do solo estiver obstruída. Um dos problemas de se visualizar a região de corte por meio de um monitor é a perda de noção de profundidade, o que pode dificultar a operação. Dessa forma, seria relevante uma técnica de visão computacional capaz de detectar as linhas de energia e seu posicionamento tridimensional (3D) a fim de auxiliar o operador. Revisando-se a literatura, avaliou-se que, no geral, os trabalhos já propostos para detecção de linhas em imagens operam em situações com fundo limpo, não urbanizado e com vista superior das linhas de energia. Assim sendo, nesse trabalho é proposta uma técnica para detecção de linhas energizadas em imagens de regiões urbanas e a obtenção de seu posicionamento 3D, fator ainda não explorado na literatura recente. Para se alcançar esse objetivo é proposta a utilização de câmeras de espectro visível posicionadas em paralelo. Assim, regiões com potencial para serem linhas de energia são selecionadas utilizando-se detecção de bordas seguidas por filtragens geométricas aplicando-se técnicas inspiradas em algoritmos de grafos e ajuste de pontos selecionados a uma curva. Após a seleção de regiões candidatas a linha de energia, o posicionamento 3D é obtido utilizando-se de visão estéreo. Para tal, a correspondência entre pontos visíveis em ambas as câmeras é encontrada e com triangulação o posicionamento 3D da linha de energia é recuperado. Com a informação 3D disponível falsos candidatos são reduzidos por um fator de aproximadamente sete vezes e finalmente as linhas são detectadas. Para avaliação do método foi criada uma base de dados contendo imagens estéreo obtidas de um cenário montado com dois postes, três linhas de energia e uma árvore entre essas, na qual foi possível atingir níveis de precisão de 98% ao término do processo de detecção, contando-se com 91% de taxa de verdadeiro positivos. As causas dos falsos negativos são evidenciadas para que trabalhos futuros possam encontrar alternativas às dificuldades apresentadas. O algoritmo aqui proposto fornece como saída um mapa de cor sobre as linhas de energia para identificação da profundidade em 2D e uma nuvem de pontos para visualização em 3D.

		"abstract": "Among various underwater robots, a deep-sea hexapod robot is able to both sail in the water and crawl on the seafloor at a large water depth. In the underwater operation process of the hexapod robot, the diving process is crucial for achieving a safe and energy efficient operation. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-awared diving control approach for an underwater hexapod robot. This paper first presents a kinematic diving motion model and analyzes the energy consumption of the robot in the diving process. After this, an energy-awared diving control approach is proposed to partition the whole diving process into four successive parts: free diving, constant speed descent, deceleration, and free landing. Each of the four parts is with a special design for the thruster and control setting. An optimization formulation of the energy-awared diving control problem has been derived and simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diving control approach.",

BLE is a new brand technology focused on information transmission using very low energy consumption. It is being included in mobile devices from year 2011, nowadays almost every new mobile phone is shipped with this technology. Robot localization using particles filter has been developed in recent years using wireless technologies with a significant success. BLE beacons measures are rather noisier than measures from similar wireless devices. In this work we make an initial model of BLE measures and their noise. The model is used to generate data to be processed by a particle filter designed for localization using only ultra-wide band (UWB) beacons ranges. Data are generated with different noise level in order to explore localization errors behavior, these levels cover real noise levels founded in RSSI measure characterization.",

Generally speaking, most of the key performance indices (KPI) of the state of discharge (SOD) can be satisfied by the series-connected cells with traditional gas-gauge if the current is small enough. However, the reliable cycle-lifespan would be shortened and KPI are no longer assured whenever the cell-inbalance phenomenon occurs under the heavy-duty discharge conditions. This paper is aimed to develop an inexpensive, lightweight, durable, reliable, and predictable cell-balance algorithm (ICBA) with parallel-connected circuit to stabilize the respective cells and protect the battery management system (BMS). A PC-based graphic-user interface (GUI) will be implemented to detect the on-line SOD and evaluate KPI for the existed cell-group. Finally, computer simulations and the SOD experiment with data acquisition are carefully examined and successfully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed algorithm.",

		"abstract": "Robots have access to an abundance of raw data. They need to understand their environment to perform their tasks and act upon local triggers. With the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), robots, with the help of powerful computing units, can now understand complex visual features, such as humans and objects. Since DNNs have high computation and power demands, to execute DNNs and achieve high performance, a robot requires state-of-the-art or domainspeciﬁc hardware. Although integrating such hardware in several scenarios is economically and logically sound (such as integrating GPUs in self-driving vehicles), for a handful of other scenarios several constraints limit this integration. For instance, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a constraint on their weight which limit their ability to carry high-capacity batteries. Thus, we need a good understating of DNNs power consumption on robots and UAVs. To understand the power consumption of robots and UAVs that execute DNNs beside their operation, we study a two-robot system with limited computing capabilities. We utilize a framework that enables collaboration among several low-power devices for enabling real-time execution of DNNs. Our execution platform includes two iRobots, each of which has been equipped with an additional Raspberry Pi 3, the power source of which is the iRobot’s battery. By executing an example DNN on interconnected Raspberry Pi 3s, while iRobots are operating, we quantify and study the power consumption effects of DNNs in our system.",

		"abstract": "Following a paper published by E. Boje[1], this thesis discusses the design and off-line testing of different types of Kalman filters to estimate the attitude, position and velocity of a robotic platform moving along a power line. The nature of this problem limits the use of magnetometers. Magnetic field interference from the steel pylons and steel cored conductors will affect the local magnetic field. Moreover, high frequency signals from on-board power electronic drives and induced magnetic fields due to ferromagnetic components of the robot along with aliasing, quantization effects and a low signal to noise ratio make notch filtering at 50 Hz impractical. Thus, a GPS/IMU filter solution, which uses the power line curvature and horizontal direction in measurements, to constrain the robot to the line was designed. Different types of filters were implemented; The Extended Kalman filter (EKF), the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the Error State Kalman filter (ErKF). Measurements were recorded and the filters were tested offline. While all the filters tracked properly, it was found that the EKF was better in computational speed completing an iteration in 87 µs, the ErKF was second best with an average time of 120 µs for one iteration and the UKF was last with an average time of 1040 µs for one iteration. Errors between the true state and estimated state for the simulation were quantified using root mean square values (RMS). The RMS values were almost the same for the EKF and ErKF with the error for the x position at 0.81 m and z position at 0.038 m. The UKF produced RMS errors of 0.79 m for x position and 0.11 m for z position. It can be seen that the UKF is slightly better for the x position but is much worse for the z position. Overall, the GPS measurement RMS values used were 4 m and 20 m for the horizontal and vertical positions respectively. Thus, the filters brought a big improvement. However, the recommended filter is the EKF as is produced comparable or better results as compared to other filters and expends the least computational effort. A state estimator was also developed for a J.Patel’s PLIR project [2], where a brachiating version of a power line robot was modeled. The brachiation mechanism was approximated to a double pendulum and kinematics based Kalman filter was designed. Simulations of EKF and UKF were made. The EKF is still recommended as its estimates are closer to the true values and its computation time is about five times faster.",

		"abstract": "Palletizing robot is widely used in logistics operation. At present, people pay attention to not only the loading capacity and working efficiency of palletizing robots, but also the energy consumption in their working process. This paper takes MD1200-YJ palletizing robot as the research object and studies the problem of low energy consumption optimization of joint driving system from the perspective of trajectory optimization. Firstly, a multifactor dynamic model of palletizing robot is established based on the conventional inverse rigid body dynamic model of the robot, the Stribeck friction model and the spring balance torque model. And then based on joint torque, friction torque, motion parameter, and joule’s law, the useful work model, thermal loss model of joint motor, friction energy consumption model of joint system, and total energy consumption model of palletizing robot are established, and through simulation and experiment, the correctness of the multifactor dynamic model and energy consumption model is verified. Secondly, based on the Fourier series approximation method to construct the joint trajectory expression, the minimum total energy consumption as the optimization objective, with coefficients of Fourier series as optimization variables, the motion parameters of initial and final position, and running time constant as constraint conditions, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Finally, through the simulation analysis the optimized Fourier series motion law and the 3-4-5 polynomial motion law are comprehensively evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the optimization method. Moreover, it provides the theoretical basis for the follow-up research and points out the direction of improvement.",

The green city is an urban environment in which the parklands and natural habitats are integrated into the living and the working space of the communities. This significant increase in the scale of parklands in the green cities requires autonomous landscaping. In this paper, a computer vision system for an autonomous landscaping robot which is capable of seeding various types of grass and designing patterns in the lawns is developed. The proposed robotic platform uses deep convolutional neural networks for finding the required patches for the replanting of the grass and the obstacle avoidance for the robot. A dataset of real parkland environment is collected and the proposed vision system is evaluated for various scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed vision system is capable of operating in complex parkland areas.",

		"abstract": "Purpose In the multi-splitting transmission lines extreme power environment of ultra-high voltage and strong electromagnetic interference, to improve the trajectory tracking and stability control performance of the robot manipulator when conduct electric power operation, and effectively reduce the influence of disturbance factors on the robot motion control, this paper aims to presents a robust trajectory tracking motion control method for power cable robot manipulators based on sliding mode variable structure control theory. Design/methodology/approach Through the layering of aerial-online-ground robot three-dimensional control architecture, the robot joint motion dynamic model has been built, and the motion control model of the N-degrees of freedom robot system has also been obtained. On this basis, the state space expression of joint motion control under disturbance and uncertainty has been also derived, and the manipulator sliding mode variable structure trajectory tracking control model has also been established. The influence of the perturbation control parameters on the robot motion control can be compensated by the back propagation neural network learning, the stability of the controller has been analyzed by using Lyapunov theory. Findings The robot has been tested on a analog line in the lab, the effectiveness of sliding mode variable structure control is verified by trajectory tracking simulation experiments of different typical signals with different methods. The field operation experiment further verifies the engineering practicability of the control method. At the same time, the control method has the remarkable characteristics of sound versatility, strong adaptability and easy expansion. Originality/value Three-dimensional control architecture of underground-online-aerial robots has been proposed for industrial field applications in the ubiquitous power internet of things environment (UPIOT). Starting from the robot joint motion, the dynamic equation of the robot joint motion and the state space expression of the robot control system have been established. Based on this, a robot closed-loop trajectory tracking control system has been designed. A robust trajectory tracking motion control method for robots based on sliding mode variable structure theory has been proposed, and a sliding mode control model for the robot has been constructed. The uncertain parameters in the control model have been compensated by the neural network in real-time, and the sliding mode robust control law of the robot manipulator has been solved and obtained. A suitable Lyapunov function has been selected to prove the stability of the system. This method enhances the expansibility of the robot control system and shortens the development cycle of the controller. The trajectory tracking simulation experiment of the robot manipulator proves that the sliding mode variable structure control can effectively restrain the influence of disturbance and uncertainty on the robot motion stability, and meet the design requirements of the control system with fast response, high tracking accuracy and sound stability. Finally, the engineering practicability and superiority of sliding mode variable structure control have been further verified by field operation experiments.",

		"abstract": "A mobile robot with no less than two powered caster wheels (PCWs) has the ability to perform omnidirectional motions and belongs to a redundantly actuated system. Redundant actuation will bring the issue of non-uniqueness of actuating torque distribution, and inappropriate choices of torque distribution schemes will lead to unexpected large required actuating torques and extra energy consumption. This paper proposes a new torque distribution optimization approach based on a gradient projection method (GPM) for the omnidirectional mobile robot (OMR) with direct drive PCWs. It can significantly reduce the maximal required actuating torque and the energy consumption of the system. The modular kinematic and dynamic modeling method is presented first, which is suitable for an arbitrary number of employed PCWs, as well as their install positions in the chassis. The detailed energy consumption model of the OMR, including output energy consumption and electrical energy loss, is formulated through experimental testing. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated by simulation examples. Lastly, the computational efficiency of the method is verified.",

		"abstract": "Up until recently, power distribution maintenance work at very high altitude, and high-voltage has been carried out manually. These tasks are usually very dangerous, as they threaten the lives of the workers performing them. Therefore, we started from this premise to conceive a more secure way to perform these power distribution works: The development of a robot which can perform autonomous distribution operations. The purpose of this study is to construct a three-dimensional model of the work environment around an electric utility pole, save it so that it can be processed and used by the robot, as the robot can perform autonomously maintenance work. In this paper, we introduce a method to build a 3-D model of the robot's working environment by superimposing a group of many 3-D point clouds to the group that was obtained using the laser range sensor in the Kinect2. The aggregation of these point clouds is done by the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm.",

In this paper a task-related analysis of the energetic performance of a 4-DOF industrial parallel robot is presented, and the optimal location of a predefined task with respect to the robot workspace is investigated. An optimal position of the task relative to the robot can indeed reduce the actuators&rsquo; effort and the energy consumption required to complete the considered operation. The dynamic and electro-mechanical models of the manipulators are developed and implemented to estimate the energy consumption of a parametrized motion with trapezoidal speed profile, i.e., a pick-and-place operation. Numerical results provide energy consumption maps that can be adopted to place the starting and ending points of the task in the more energy-efficient location within the robot workspace.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, a hybrid system topology with one-way wireless charging function and the function of the bi-directional data communication is proposed for the problem of electric energy replenishment and data transmission faced by robot fish in the implementation of autonomous submarine cable inspection. Three working modes of the system and the time-sharing multiplexing method are studied. In the power transmission mode, high-efficiency wireless charging is realized by utilizing the transmission characteristics of a series&ndash;series (SS)-type resonant network which involves series resonant networks in both the primary side and the secondary side. In the alignment detection and handshake communication mode, the charging platform distance recognition and the handshake signal transmission are implemented through a series&ndash;parallel (SP)-type resonant network based on the ASK (amplitude shift keying) modulation method. In the high-speed data transmission mode, the reverse (secondary to primary) high-speed transmission of the inspection data is achieved through a SP-type resonant network based on the OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation method. The three modes share the same coupled coils via a reconfigurable resonant network. The working principle of the system is expounded, the system characteristics under each working mode are analyzed, and the time-division multiplexing control strategy is given. The rationality and effectiveness of the scheme are verified by experiments.",

		"abstract": "As autonomous tiling devices begin to perform floor cleaning, agriculture harvesting, surface painting tasks, with minimal or no human intervention, a new challenge arises: these devices also need to be energy efficient and be constantly aware of the energy expenditure during deployments. Typical approaches to this end are often limited to fixed morphology robots with little or no consideration for reconfiguring class of robots. The main contribution of the paper is an energy estimation scheme that allows estimating the energy consumption when a tetromino inspired reconfigurable floor tiling robot, hTetro moves from one configuration to another for completing the area covering task. To this end, the proposed model applying the Newton-Raphson algorithm in combination with Pulse width modulation (PWM)-H bridge to characterize the energy cost associated with locomotion gaits across all valid morphologies and identify optimal area coverage strategy among available options is presented. We validate our proposed approach using an 8&rsquo; &times; 8&rsquo; square testbed where there exist 12 possible solutions for complete area coverage however with varying levels of energy cost. Then, we implemented our approach to our hTetro platform and conducted experiments in a real-life environment. Experimental results demonstrate the application of our model in identifying the optimal area coverage strategy that has the least associated energy cost.",

		"abstract": "Given the dynamic model of a planar robot manipulator with two revolute joints, the initial state, and some specifications about the final state of the system, we find the trajectory and the actuator forces that minimize the energy consumption during the motion. We solve this optimal control problem using an approach based on the Euler–Lagrange necessary condition in integral form in which time is discretized and admissible variations for each variable are approximated using a linear combination of piecewise-continuous basis functions of time. Our method consists in a numerical resolution of an unconstrained reformulation of the optimal control problem in which the dynamic equation is regarded as a constraint. Then, we use a damped Newton methodology to solve the resulting nonlinear system of difference equations. The required initial guess of the solution is obtained using a trigonometric polynomial interpolation. The use of the Euler–Lagrange necessary condition in integral form avoids the numerical intricacy caused by the presence of corner of the extremals. In this way a general method for the solution of optimal control problems is obtained in which constraints on the state can be easily introduced. The accuracy of the proposed procedure is assessed by comparing the obtained global error with different discretization sizes. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been compared with a direct transcription method, a widely used procedure to solve optimal control problems.",

It lacks effective means to manage switch station equipment. This paper designs a rail-robot based remote three-dimensional inspection system for switch stations. Remote automatic inspection of the switchgear and real-time monitoring of the switch station environment are achieved by providing an infrared window on the switchgear and mounting a rail-robot equipped with an infrared thermal imager and an ultrasonic partial discharge detector outside the switchgear. Further, video analysis technologies are used in the system to identify operation conditions of switch station equipment, which together with fault alarming, event linkage action and other functions. It is conducive to the monitoring and management of the switch station, thus improving the security and reliability of the switch stations.",

		"abstract": "When a robot is designed, usually the weight of the same motors limits the maximum payload of the robot. While the designer tries to increase the power of the motors to give the robot better payload capacity, by doing so, it also makes the robot itself heavier and then the improvement in payload capacity is lost in lifting the robot itself. Many approaches to improve payload capacity consist in using an existing commercial electric motor and modifying it by adding external accessories to avoid non-safe motor internal heat. They usually use a mechanic reduction to increase payload capacity, but they lose maximum speed at the same time. Currently, there are no proper solutions for a motor in a humanoid robot application that manages to lift very heavy objects at high speed and that at the same time the motors are small and lightweight. In order to obtained more power from the robot joint actuator, in this paper we propose and compared a new thermal channel and thermal sealed jacket design for a permanent magnet electric motor to solve this problem. The design takes advantage of the fractional-slot concentrated-winding motor configuration and its fill factor to force liquid and air directly to the winding separately, in order to examine their head extradition to increase its performance in a specify scenario. The propose design shows an improvement in relation to the head extraction of the sealed jacket design with respect to the thermal channels when forcing liquid through them. Both designs are simulated assuming an extreme scenario where the winding reaches 100 °C for validation purposes. The experiments were carried out in the Ansys CFD Software to evaluate their heat transfer behavior.",

Aiming at the problem that the traditional trajectory tracking algorithm for this kind of robots cannot consider the input redundancy, a minimum-energy trajectory tracking algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a kinematics model of four-wheeled omni-directional mobile robot is built. Secondly, a trajectory tracking controller is designed based on the kinematics model. And then, considering the wheel velocity redundancy, a particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm hybrid optimization algorithm (PSO-GA) are applied to search for the best inputs by minimizing the motion energy. Finally, the simulation of trajectory tracking control system is carried out on the platform of Matlab 2016a. The results indicate that the trajectory tracking control system of four-wheeled omni-directional mobile robot based on the designed algorithm has good stability and accuracy with minimum-energy consumption.",

The aim of the optimization is to find free time between operations, where it is possible to extend the execution time of the robot movements, and thereby saving energy, without extending the cycle time of the whole station. The station is modeled and optimized in a simulation platform. The optimization algorithm works by iteratively limiting the maximum velocity of the robot movements, until no more free time exists. Simulation results show that the energy use, peak power and jerk of the robots can be reduced significantly.",

Omnidirectional autonomous mobile robots without any nonholonomic constraints can reach the same goal pose from the same start pose via too many feasible trajectories, each consuming different amounts of energy. It is both economically beneficial and academically interesting to optimize the omnidirectional trajectories of holonomic Mecanum autonomous mobile robots for energy minimization. The aim of this PhD research was to first develop a heavy-duty omnidirectional Mecanum mobile robot that can perform fully functional autonomous navigation for research purposes, and then to realize energy-efficient autonomous navigation on the designed robot via both online and offline optimal motion planning research studies. A heavy-duty omnidirectional Mecanum robot platform was designed and developed from the beginning. The robotic control system architecture that allows the robot to perform autonomous navigation was realized by fusing an industrial automation control system and open-source autonomous navigation technologies. Then an experimentally validated novel energy consumption model of the four-wheel omnidirectional Mecanum mobile robot was proposed based on a comprehensive understanding of the kinematics, dynamics and energy flow of the robot. In order to realize energy-efficient autonomous navigation, both online and offline optimal planners were presented in this research. The proposed online planner extended the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) by means of a new energy-optimal omnidirectional velocity search technique for the purposes of optimizing motional power consumption and reducing energy consumption for autonomous navigation. The offline planner proposed a method of trajectory generation that interpolates the task-space trajectory of the omnidirectional robot in polynomial spline functions and then searches for the energy-optimal trajectories using genetic algorithms. Both proposed online and offline planning methods were experimentally validated.",

		"abstract": "Motion planning plays an important role in the performance optimization of legged robots. This paper presents a method to minimize the impact force and energy consumption effectively by providing an integrated strategy of motion planning subject to velocity and acceleration constraints. The parameters defined for the motion planning are computed to generate the foot trajectory. A foot–terrain interaction model and an energy-consumption model are formulated to evaluate the contact force and power consumption for statically stable gaits. The proposed method has been implemented on a hexapod robot. The acceleration of foot landing is reduced, and constant velocity control of the trunk body with passive compliant ankles is achieved for reducing the impact force and energy consumption. Extensive experiments have been carried out, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with a conventional method.",

However, the root causes of the reduced heaviness as well as the factors affecting the heaviness are still unknown. The knowledge on the root causes and factors could be used to modulate the interactions between the human user and the robot when lifting objects with it. This paper investigated the reasons and factors behind the reduced heaviness of objects lifted with a power assist system. We hypothesized that weight perception due to inertia might be different from that due to gravity when lifting an object with a power assist system because the actual weight and the perceived weight were different. Subjects lifted objects manually and with power-assist separately. We compared load forces and motion features for the manually lifted objects to that for the power-assisted objects and found that the load force and its rate, velocity and acceleration for the power-assisted objects were lower than that for the manually lifted objects. We noticed that there were time delays in force sensing, position sensing, servomotor etc. for the power-assisted objects, but not for the manually lifted objects. We assumed that the delays were responsible for the reduced heaviness of objects lifted with power-assist. Finally, we proposed to use the findings to develop human-friendly power assist devices for manipulating heavy objects in industries that would help improve/modulate interactions between users and robots.",

		"abstract": "Realizing adaptability to environmental changes requires the robot’s body to change according to the environment. From this perspective, several studies have considered variable compliant actuation to change the physical characteristics of the robot as it interacts with the environment. Robots with this ability show a variety of efficient stable motions during contact with the environment. However, having locally variable compliant parts with independent dynamics under the same body may be insufficient for achieving adaptability in diverse environments. To extend the idea of variable compliant actuation, from being used locally to the level of the entire body’s dynamics, in this study, we use an actuator network system (ANS). As an approximation of bipedal robots, we developed an eight-legged rimless wheel robot with an ANS that allows energy transfer among limbs through passive interactions among mutually interconnected air cylinders mounted on the robot’s legs. We experimentally demonstrated that by using the ANS to realize energy transfer among limbs, the robot performance improved.",

For this problem, we propose a posture balance control method, which actively attenuate kinetic energy of the robot. Based on simplified dynamics model established for the foot rotating situation, our control law is deduced to adjust the amplitude of the ground contact force (GCF) and the angular acceleration of the robot foot rotation simultaneously. Then the posture balance controller against the impact force disturbance is designed. Stability of the foot rotation phase space is analyzed for our controller and other two existing controllers. Also, the situation of no balance controller is analyzed as a presentation of the system's passive characteristic. Then area of the stable region is compared between these three controllers. Simulations under frontal impact disturbances are also conducted. The results demonstrate that, our controller is able to resist stronger impact disturbance and make the robot recover its balance in a shorter time. This indicates that, compared with other posture control methods, the proposed control method makes better use of the robot joint motion to attenuate the robot's kinetic energy.",

		"abstract": "The comprehensive evaluation of the performance parameters of the mobile welding robot driven by the fuel cell hybrid power system is beneficial to optimizing the energy efficiency and control performance of the system. However, few studies have paid attention to this aspect. Rough analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method are used to calculate the weight of the evaluation index. Cloud model is used to synthesize all evaluation indicators to determine the status level. First, the golden section method is used to determine the evaluation criteria, and through cloud model, the evaluation criteria and measured parameters of the single evaluation index are transformed into corresponding evaluation reference clouds and evaluation clouds. Second, the weight of the evaluation index is determined by the method of the rough analytic hierarchy process, and the method of the entropy weight is used to revise the method of the rough analytic hierarchy process. The single evaluation reference cloud and evaluation cloud are aggregated to get the comprehensive evaluation reference cloud, and the comprehensive evaluation of the reference cloud is carried out. The evaluation cloud for each evaluation cycle. Finally, according to the correlation between the comprehensive evaluation cloud and the comprehensive evaluation standard cloud, the performance level of each evaluation cycle is determined. In this paper, the randomness and fuzziness of the qualitative concepts are solved by using the characteristics of the cloud model. Combined with rough analytic hierarchy process, the objectivity of the data is maintained and the advantages of the expert evaluation are enhanced. The validity of the model is verified by comparing the existing methods. These studies evaluate and classify the real-time status of the fuel cell robot, and provide a basis for the performance optimization and energy optimization of the hybrid power system controllers.",

		"abstract": "To ensure the riveting quality and avoid riveting defects such as overdriven head or underdriven head, elastic and plastic mechanical analysis of the riveting process has been studied and a riveting energy control method is proposed in this paper. According to the target size of the driven head, the material properties, and the interference, the total riveting energy is calculated. Then, the relation of riveting duration and riveting energy is established to realize the control of the riveting impact energy in practical engineering. Furthermore, plastic dynamic impact buckling of the rivet is also analyzed to get impact buckling critical speed. Due to the dual-robot posture adjustment and countersunk self-centering ability, the working axes of the riveting tools, rivet, and hole are found to be well coaxial. The analysis shows there is little phenomenon of rivet bending in the dual-robot pneumatic riveting system and the impact buckling critical speed is much higher than the piston impact speed. Finally, finite element model is built for riveting dynamic simulation and dual-robot pneumatic riveting cell for fuselage panel assembly is developed to obtain experimental results. The comparison shows the proposed method has a good performance. The research results enhance the knowledge of energy effect of dual-robot pneumatic riveting, and thus offer positive guidance for practical application in aircraft assembly.",

		"abstract": "Researchers have been studying biped robots for many years, and, while many advances in the field have been accomplished, there still remain the challenge to transfer the existing solutions into real applications. The main issues are related to mobility and autonomy. In mobility, biped robots have evolved greatly, nevertheless they are still far from what a human can do in the work-site. Similarly, autonomy of biped platforms has been tackled on several different grounds, but its core problem still remains, and it is associated to energy issues. Because of these energy issues, lately the main attention has been redirected to the long term autonomy of the biped robotics platforms. For that, much effort has been made to develop new more energy-efficient biped robots.\r\n\r\nThe GIMBiped project in Aalto University was established to tackle the previous issues in energy efficiency and mobility, through the study and implementation of dynamic and energy-efficient bipedal robotic waking. This thesis falls into the first studies needed to achieve the previous goal using the GIMBiped testbed, starting with a detailed analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of the target system, using a modeling and simulation tools. This work also presents an assessment of different control techniques based on Limit Cycle walking, carried out on a two-dimensional kneed bipedal simulator.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a numerical continuation analysis of the mechanical parameters of the first GIMBiped prototype was performed, using the same approximated planar kneed biped model. This study is done to analyze the effect that such variations in the mechanical design parameters produce in the stability and energy-efficiency of the system.Finally, experiments were performed in the GIMBiped testbed. These experiments show the results of a hybrid control technique proposed by the author, which combines traditional ZMP-based walking approach with a Limit Cycle trajectory-following control. Furthermore the results of a pure ZMP-based type of control are also presented.",

		"abstract": "To efficiently transmit electric power to consumers, the power lines need to be inspected routinely for early fault detection. Thus, power line inspection robots are designed to replace the tedious and dangerous manual inspection using linemen or helicopters. However, most of the existing inspection robots are heavy, which make them slow and prone to external wind disturbance. This paper developed a lightweight dual-arm robot and investigates its robustness to wind disturbance on a lab-scale power line structure. The dynamic equations of the robot are derived using the Lagrangian equation for appropriate motor selection. Also, the components of the robot are designed to ensure low drag coefficient to wind flow, and the mechanism of the wind force on the robot-line coupled system is presented. To study the real-time impact of the wind, a wind speed of 4.5 m/s representing one of the windiest cities in China is considered as a case study. The experimental results for different wind directions, namely, 0°, 45°, and 90°, show that the maximum vibration is 8% higher than the normal vibration of the system in a controlled environment without wind. The results demonstrate that there is little influence of the wind on the system; hence, the robot has been successfully designed and can be applied for power line inspection.",

		"abstract": "Wireless power transmission (WPT) systems with moveable mechanical parts have been acquired more and more attention during the past decade. However, due to the moveable feature of transmitting coil and receiving coil, misalignment issue lead to extra power loss, decrease in efficiency, increase in control complexity, and unwanted performance degradation of the whole system. Moreover, it happened frequently than those traditional planar coils systems. The motivation for this paper is trying to have a deep understanding of quantitative relationship between ball-shaped coils mutual inductance and misalignment. Based upon that, engineers would know more detail of the coils position and mutual inductance. So, optimized design might be achieved. On considering that, this paper presents a WPT system with a ball-shaped coil for robot joints. A mutual inductance calculation based on filament method aimed at ball-shaped coil is proposed. Based on these, nine different ball-shaped coil solutions are calculated. Then, model with a minimized change rate of mutual inductance against the angular misalignment is chosen as the optimized design. Circuit analysis of the WPT system with the series–series resonant topology is conducted to choose a proper working frequency and load. Finally, an experimental platform is established. It demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed calculation method and the feasibility of the WPT prototype.",

		"abstract": "Continuous operation of the electrical transmission lines is of great importance for today's electricity-dependent world. It is crucial to detect and diagnose a possible problem on the lines before that occurs. In general, maintenance, repair and error detection operations of the electrical transmission lines are performed by humans periodically. However, these difficult tasks contain high-risks in terms of occupational health and safety. Moreover, it is not possible to continuously inspect these lines which extend over long distances by maintenance and repair personnel. For all these reasons, it is very convenient to use robotic systems for inspection on power transmission lines. By evaluating the data which are provided from sensors and cameras of robotic systems, it would be possible to take precautions before an error occurs. Robotic systems that can move continuously along the line would be able to gather continuous and uninterrupted information. Thus, potential problems can be detected and identified in advance. In this study, a single wheel drive low-cost mobile robot is designed and controlled which can work and move on the electrical transmission lines. Because of the modular structure of the designed robot, different types of sensors can be integrated into the robot, easily. The designed low-cost robotic system will cause minimum losses in case of possible breakage.",

To select suitable motor and battery, load distribution of the vehicle is discussed by considering all resistance factors.\r\nAppropriate object oriented programing is developed in Arduino environment and uploaded to the Arduino Uno ATmega328. And also Proteus software is used to develop the schematic capture of the system from input to output. PID controller is designed to control speed of differential drive motors and simulation is done on MATLAB Simulink environment.\r\nResults of transient and steady state response of right and left wheel motors’ controllers are shown using MATLAB scope graphs. Effects of chassis parameters and contribution of right and left motors on motion of the vehicle are simulated and there results in MATLAB scope graphs are compared.\r\nSimulation of hardware interfacing of the system components with the Controller (Arduino UNO) is done using Proteus Software. The robot platform is well-ordered by controlling speed and position of the two PMDC motors using the driver L293D. LCD is interfaced for displaying statues of the battery, seed box and general information of the robot.

		"abstract": "The hydraulic servo actuator with passive compliance (HPCA) is designed for hydraulically-driven quadruped robots. It is characterized by an accumulator that connects to the piston chamber of the hydraulic cylinder to buffer impact forces between a robot&rsquo;s feet and the ground. This paper studies the energy efficiency of this actuator in the dynamic locomotion of a quadruped robot. Different from the traditional methods of storing potentially recyclable energy using accumulators, the energy-saving principle of HPCA is to utilize the pressure-transition characteristics of the asymmetric hydraulic cylinder with control of the symmetrical valve. The accumulator can store and release oil during the switching of the transition point in each gait cycle of the robot, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the actuator. The influence of the initial inflation pressure and working volume of the accumulator on the energy efficiency of the HPCA is studied by simulation and physical experiments.

		"abstract": "Collision-free autonomous path planning under a dynamic and uncertainty vineyard environment is the most important issue which needs to be resolved firstly in the process of improving robotic harvesting manipulator intelligence. We present and apply energy optimal and artificial potential field to develop a path planning method for six degree of freedom (DOF) serial harvesting robot under dynamic uncertain environment. Firstly, the kinematical model of Six-DOF serial manipulator was constructed by using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method. The model of obstacles was defined by axis-aligned bounding box, and then the configuration space of harvesting robot was described by combining the obstacles and arm space of robot. Secondly, the harvesting sequence in path planning was computed by energy optimal method, and the anticollision path points were automatically generated based on the artificial potential field and sampling searching method. Finally, to verify and test the proposed path planning algorithm, a virtual test system based on virtual reality was developed. After obtaining the space coordinates of grape picking point and anticollision bounding volume, the path points were drew out by the proposed method. 10 times picking tests for grape anticollision path planning were implemented on the developed simulation system, and the success rate was up to 90%. The results showed that the proposed path planning method can be used to the harvesting robot.",

Measurement of radiation distribution inside the FDNPS buildings is indispensable to execute decommissioning tasks in the reactor buildings. We conducted a radiation imaging experiment inside the reactor building of Unit 1 of FDNPS by using a compact Compton camera mounted on a crawler robot and remotely visualized gamma-rays streaming from deep inside the reactor building. Moreover, we drew a radiation image obtained using the Compton camera onto the three-dimensional (3-D) structural model of the experimental environment created using photogrammetry. In addition, the 3-D model of the real working environment, including the radiation image, was imported into the virtual space of the virtual reality system. These visualization techniques help workers recognize radioactive contamination easily and decrease their own exposure to radiation because the contamination cannot be observed with the naked eye.",

Many physical and rather dangerous tasks in pot-lines are still required to be carried out by a floor operator. The manual manipulation of pot hoods required for anode changing is a good example. The Embedded Service Robot (ESR) is an additional tool of the Pot Tending Machine (PTM) designed and developed to assist the pot-room operators during this operation and further safeguard them against the hazards of the smelter environment. The ESR is based on industrial robotics and driven in automatic, semi-automatic or manual mode. It is able to perform many different duties with limited impact on PTM cycle time.",

		"abstract": "Robots are widely used in industry due to their efficiency and high accuracy in performance. One of the most intriguing issues in manufacturing stage of production line is to minimize significantly high percentage of energy consumed by these robot manipulators. The energy optimal control of robotic manipulators is a complex problem, as it requires a deep understanding of the robot's kinematics and dynamic behaviors. This paper propose a novel method of energy efficient path planning of an industrial robot arm in a workspace with multiple obstacles using differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The path-planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem with an aim to determine the shortest and energy optimal path of the robot arm from its given initial position to the pre-defined goal location, without hitting obstacles. Application of such evolutionary algorithms in trajectory planning is advantageous because the exact solution to the path-planning problem is not always available beforehand and must be determined dynamically. Experiments undertaken reveal that the DE-based path-planning algorithm outperforms its contenders in a significant manner.",

The correlation results can be used to stabilize and control problems when a mobile base robot is subjected to various types of external disturbances. This is because different robot system energy values display different stability distribution curves. Mobile base robot stability based on varying system’s energy is described. Two control strategies, computed force/torque and adaptive compensators, are applied to minimize uncertainties accompanied by the robot’s movements. The two compensators are then compared by simulating applied external disturbances, such as mobile base tipping motion and load mass changes on the robot end-effector. A comprehensive comparison with other methods is also described. The proposed technique is a useful tool in the maintenance of the degree of control and stability of the system and has various applications in the mobile robot tasks including choosing and placing operations, maneuvering around the workspace with protruding obstacles on sinuous shape paths, and manufacturing tasks.",

		"abstract": "Robotic instruments have recently been widely introduced into industrial  automation.  As energy supply and demand have become global issues, energy saving in  industrial robots has become urgent.  In general industrial pick-and-place robots, servomotors periodically  repeat acceleration and deceleration, consequently lose much energy in motion.  We propose a mechanism using an in-frame parallel spring for the pick-and-place  robot.  During motion, spring blades deform and store energy, then release it as  energy of motion, enabling the mechanism to recycle energy that have been lost  in conventional mechanisms.  In this paper, a 1 DOF proof-of-concept prototype and preliminary feasibility  tests are described.  In this study, we applied in-frame parallel springs to a mechanism for  pick-and-place robot.  The parallel springs are fabricated from spring steel SK85M (Young’s modulus:  210 GPa) with 252 mm long, 50 mm wide and 0.3 mm thick.  The results suggest that the prototype can achieve a repeated motion with the  range of ±145.7 mm in 2.56 Hz by 1.17 W, greatly reduced from that of the  the traditional mechanisms.  In addition, it is desired to stop the robot immediately in regular motion if  anomalies occurred in industrial applications.  The prototype showed that an immediate stop in 0.6 s was feasible by  dissipating elastic energy stored in spring blades, confirming the feasibility  of our proposed mechanism.",

		"abstract": "Part 1\r\nDriver assistance systems show the potential to increase the fuel economy and optimize the range of standard and electric vehicles. Eco-driving focused systems optimize velocity trajectories with respect to energy consumption and suggest these optimized speeds to drivers with the goal of reducing overall energy consumption. Because the systems have no direct control over vehicle behavior, the driver’s inclination to follow the commands is important to their effectiveness. This can be improved by personalizing the velocity commands to suit an individual’s driving behavior, requiring a model capable of accurately predicting styles of individual drivers. Two methods for identifying, modeling, and predicting driver behavior using driving data time-series are investigated. The first, pattern recognition-based approach breaks down the data into homogeneous segments using heuristic, dynamic programming, and bottom-up methods. Segments are grouped based on acceleration behavior and used, in conjunction with function-fit regression and system identification methods, to construct models describing driving behavior. Contrary to the first approach, the second, machine learning based method constructs a model using an entire time-series by analyzing relationships between multiple variables. Finally, each method is evaluated in it’s ability to accurately predict driver acceleration and velocity behavior. Part 2\r\nEnforcing multiple, sometimes conflicting control objectives is a challenge present in modern advanced driver assistance systems. Drivers are capable of activating multiple modules simultaneously where safety must be guaranteed at all times. Examples includes adaptive speed regulation, where the vehicle must achieve a desired speed while maintaining a safe distance to any preceding vehicle, and lane keeping, where a vehicle is kept safely within the bounds of a lane. Provably safe algorithms for both adaptive speed regulation and lane keeping are introduced and used to run experiments on two robotic testbeds. The underlying algorithms are based on control Lyapunov functions for performance, a control barrier functions for safety, and a real-time quadratic program for mediating the conflicting demands between the two. The Robotarium, a robotic testbed that allows students, as well as researchers less experienced with hardware, to experiment with advanced control concepts in a safe and standardized environment, is compared with a more expensive OptiTrack based Khepera robot testbed.",

By analyzing the speed regulation mode of the speed-regulating mechanism of discharge flow, the dynamic equation for the fluid drive of the in-pipe robot is established, and according to the requirements of the inspection conditions of the in-pipe robot on the moving speed, the dynamic model of the speed regulation for the fast motion and deceleration drive is proposed. Furthermore, the energy consumption evaluation model of the composite driving in-pipe robot is established, the speed regulation characteristics and energy consumption variation characteristics of the in-pipe robot adapted to three kinds of the inspection conditions are studied by simulation. The energy consumption variation rule of the in-pipe robot with different moving speed and fluid pressure is analyzed and studied by using the experimental prototype of the composite driving in-pipe robot, and the valuable conclusions are obtained.",

		"abstract": "Various path planning schemes for multiple robots have been proposed, most of which consider factors like shortest distance, and task priority. For service robots which are in continuous operation, frequent recharging is often required at charging (docking) stations. Hence, the available power is also one of the main factors which must be considered while path planning. Moreover, docking stations are expensive and occupy space. Hence, an intelligent management of limited number of docking points for a large number of robots is required. This paper proposes a multi-robot path planning scheme which considers the available power in the robots along with other factors like task priority, and can manage a limited number of docking points for a large number of robots. Conditions of collision avoidance, emergency, and when all docking points are occupied are also discussed. Experimental results in real environment show that the proposed path planning scheme is able to allocate the most appropriate dock to the robots.",

		"abstract": "Weakness is inherently associated with ageing society. In fact, Exoskeleton robotic\r\ntechnology can be used to provide assistance for age society to perform activities of daily\r\nliving (ADL) without depending on others.\r\nUpper limb exoskeleton robots are much suitable to perform ADL. Typically, upper limb\r\nexoskeleton robot consists of number of joints and links which are corresponding to joints\r\nand limbs of human upper limb. Further, exoskeleton robots differ from other conventional\r\nrobots due to present of close interaction with wearer. In general, two types of interaction\r\ncan be seen in exoskeleton robots: physical human robot interaction (pHRI) and cognitive\r\nhuman robot interaction (cHRI).Strengthening features of cHRI can be seen on recent\r\ndevelopments of upper limb exoskeleton robots. However, there exists a vacuum to identify\r\naspects of pHRI relating to performance of exoskeleton robots.\r\nThe research work of this thesis is focused to design an upper limb exoskeleton robot for\r\nmotion assist taking effect of kinematic redundancy. The proposed exoskeleton robot (6-\r\nREXOS) has four active degree of freedom (DOF) and two passive DOF in its kinematic\r\nchain. Two passive DOF are provided to 6-REXOS by means of flexible bellow coupling\r\nand those are positioned at wrist and elbow joint of the 6-REXOS to keep their axes parallel\r\nto each other. This configuration enhances kinematic redundancy in 6-REXOS. The effect of\r\nredundancy is verified with respect to dexterity measures, such as manipulability index,\r\nminimum singular value, and condition number. Further, manipulation of end-effector of 6-\r\nREXOS due to kinematic redundancy in operational space is presented base on\r\nmanipulability ellipsoids.\r\n4DOF kinematic model for human lower arm is proposed in thesis. Manipulability measure\r\nof human kinematic model is used to benchmark the performance of 6-REXOS. Different\r\nmeasures are taken into account in design of 6-REXOS to ensure smooth pHRI. Passive\r\ncompliance of bellow coupling in order to reduce kinematic discrepancy as well as improve\r\nthe manipulation of 6-REXOS is highlighted in this thesis.",

		"abstract": "Various robots that operate in dangerous environments have been developed. A robot falling down is a critical incident, and many studies have been conducted to avoid the rollover situation. However, in a disaster site, the robot may rollover even if previous control methods are implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a control method to recover from the rollover situation. The objective of this study is to realize autonomous control for the rollover recovery of a rescue robot. Initially, subcrawlers are controlled to reduce the normalized energy stability margin. Subsequently, if the robot cannot recover by using the subcrawlers, a manipulator is used to push the ground, rotate the robot, and then recover from the rollover situation. The experiment was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method using the Gazebo simulator where a dynamics engine, named the Open Dynamics Engine, was installed.",

An approximate solution is derived firstly; with 1-D linear interpolation for errors compensating, the accurate solution can then be achieved.

		"abstract": "There has been remarkable growth in most real-time systems in the area of autonomous mobile robots. Collision-free path planning is one of the critical requirements in designing mobile robot systems since they all  featured some obstacle detection techniques. This work focuses on the collaborations of  low cost multi-sensor system to produce a complementary collision-free path for mobile robots. The proposed algorithm is used with a new model to produce the shortest, and most energy-efficient path from a given initial point to a goal point.  Multiple sensors are utilized together, so the benefits of one compensate for the limitations of the other. The experimental results demonstrate that the robot is capable of measuring different distances to obstacles in unknown environments. Moreover, this work aims to minimize the energy consumption of a wheeled mobile robot in dynamic environments. The total energy consumption is evaluated in multiple directions, where both motional energy and operational energy are considered, while the robot is moving in dynamic environments and avoiding collisions. A time complexity analysis and a comparison of the proposed model, and states-of-arts methods are presented by using required resources and the overall performance of the proposed model.  The proposed model is characterized by its low cost, low power consumption, and its efficiencies to follow the shortest path while avoiding collisions.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based implementation of Acceleration Velocity Obstacle based Collision Avoidance for an omni-directional robot with acceleration constraint. A novel Globally Asynchronous-Locally Synchronous (GALS) architecture using hybrid parallel-pipelined design is being used for the implementation. FPGA offers highly parallel hardware architectures that are not possible on conventional high end processors or other embedded controllers. Specifically, a parallel architecture for collision avoidance is proposed that portrays the advantages of FPGA implementation over the sequential implementation for same processor or clock speed with the objective of parallelizing the computation. The proposed two-tier GALS architecture based system with hybrid parallel-pipelined architectural design when realized on FPGA shows its efficiency in terms of power, resources and response time in comparison with a conventional GALS design. Due to the asynchronous design, a good amount of logic in the hardware becomes combinational logic and hence a significant reduction in the total resource utilization and power-delay product (PDP) in the proposed architecture is observed. This paper also shows the clear advantage of using the FPGA instead of a general purpose processor for robotic system design.",

		"abstract": "The increase in air pollution has led to an enhancement in need & usage of air purifier. In the past two years, especially in the months of October and November, the usage of indoor air purifier has increased drastically in National capital region of India when particulate matter has crossed the acceptable limits. The raise in indoor air pollution had led to severe concerns to elderly people, infants and asthmatic patients even if they stay back at home. Commonly static room air purifiers are used, but a movable air purifier which can sense the location of higher concentration of air pollution and move the system accordingly can improve the overall efficiency of the air purifier. This type of air purifier needs electricity to run. This paper proposes a self-power generating air purifier robot, which is capable of electricity generation, sensing air quality and air purifying by moving it to desired location. Hence this robot can be utilized both by urban and rural area people. The robot has four components namely, renewable energy generation module, air filter module, sensory module to sense the presence of PM 25 particle to determine how much air purification is required and finally data analytics module which will help in identifying the location where air purification is to be done.",

		"abstract": "Purpose To improve the operational efficiency and intelligence of live operation robots in dynamic-unstructured operation environments, this paper aims to propose a fuzzy logic-based method for the autonomous search and visual localization control of a manipulator end effector applied to a drainage plate bolt on a high-voltage transmission line. The proposed approach is based on a four-way video image information output from a dual-operation manipulator. Design/methodology/approach First, based on the structural characteristics of the drainage line, an autonomous search method for the drainage plate bolt and a mapping relationship between the autonomous search control parameters and the relative posture of the operation manipulator-drainage line are proposed. The posture control parameters of the dual manipulators can then be obtained, and a two-dimensional fuzzy controller is designed with the posture offset distance and the posture offset angle as its input signals. This enables the localization control of the bolt and nut alignment to be realized through a visual process. Findings The proposed fuzzy control algorithm is used for bolt location control, and its performance is compared with that of the conventional approach. The simulation results indicate that the fuzzy control algorithm greatly improves the localization accuracy and operational efficiency of live operation robots. Originality/value Field operation experiments on actual transmission lines verify that the fuzzy control-based visual localization control of the robot manipulator has great engineering practicality. Therefore, the proposed method further improves operational intelligence compared with conventional algorithms.",

Turning gaits are the most general and important factors for omni-directional walking of a six-legged robot. This paper presents an analysis on energy consumption of a six-legged robot during its turning motion over a flat terrain. An energy consumption model is developed for statically stable wave gaits in order to minimize dissipating energy for optimal feet forces distributions. The effects of gait parameters, namely angular velocity, angular stroke and duty factors are studied on energy consumption, as the six-legged robot walks along a circular path of constant radius with wave gait. The variations of average power consumption and energy consumption per unit weight per unit traveled length with the angular velocity and angular stroke are compared for the turning gaits of a robot with four different duty factors. Computer simulations show that wave gait with a low duty factor is more energy-efficient compared to that with a high duty factor at the highest possible angular velocity. A stability analysis based on normalized energy stability margin is performed for turning motion of the robot with four duty factors for different angular strokes.",

In this paper, a power series based inverse-kinematics algorithm is presented, by which the transcendental equation including trigonometric function can be converted into an algebraic equation. An approximate solution is derived first by means of power series expansions; with 1D linear interpolation for errors compensating, the final solution with small error can then be achieved. For robot with linearly coupled joints, the algorithms based on power series expanded to quadratic and quartic terms are used to calculate the accurate joint angles.

		"abstract": "According to the operational requirements of citrus harvesting robot, a new harvesting sequence planning method and its intelligent optimization algorithm are proposed based on the existing harvesting sequence planning methods, which realized dynamic planning for inverse kinematics solution selection and sequence planning. The simulation results show that the energy consumption is reduced by the proposed method. By means of harvesting robot, the harvesting sequence planning based on the principle of ‘minimum energy consumption’ and principle of ‘shortest path’ are carried out respectively, and the energy consumption is counted. The results show, compared with the multi-citrus harvesting algorithm based on the principle of ‘shortest path’, the proposed method based on the principle of ‘minimum energy consumption’ and dual intelligent optimization algorithm can realize the continuous multi-citrus harvesting, and reduce the energy and time consumption as a whole. The energy consumed by the proposed algorithm is reduced by about 12.5% when the number of harvesting points is 3–8, and about 23.0% when the number of harvesting points is 9–12. The average time consumed by the proposed algorithm is reduced by about 13.0% when the number of harvesting points is 3–8, and about 22.0% when the number of harvesting points is 9–12.",

In the national strategic planning calculus, when the strategy for applying ways and means outstrips desired ends, the resulting outcome is risk. Autonomous power, the fruitful combination of artificial intelligence with autonomy, creates a method of producing ways and means at a scale unprecedented in human history, driving down risk. Imagine if a nation could accomplish all of the ends dictated by core national interests and still possess a surplus of ways and means designated for accomplishing the altruistic endeavors that so frequently lose out in a world hamstrung by limited resources. So powerful is this new concept that it bears consideration as a new element of national power, perhaps even more dominant than the diplomatic, information, military and economic elements of the past.",

Recently, various types of wearable walking assist robots have been developed to improve gait function and metabolic efficiency for elderly adults. Several studies have shown that walking assist robots can improve cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during level walking in elderly. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating the effect of walking assist robots on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair walking in elderly adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the assistance effect of a newly developed wearable hip assist robot on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, dynamic formulation, system identification and motion control for a liquid crystal display (LCD) glass-handling robot system are studied. Hamilton’s principle is employed to derive Lagrange’s equations of both flexible and rigid models for an LCD glass-handling robot driven by a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The real-coded genetic algorithm is adopted to identify all the parameters of the robot and PMSM simultaneously, and to search for the unknown coefficients of polynomials for the point-to-point trajectories by minimizing the input absolute electrical energy (IAEE). In this paper, variable structure controller (VSC) is realized to track the minimum IAEE point-to-point trajectory with a sliding-mode observer. In numerical simulations, vibrations due to flexibility of the timing belts are investigated for the angular displacements, speeds, accelerations of arms, and the horizontal and vertical displacements of the robot. In comparisons of numerical simulations and experimental results, it is demonstrated that identification results of the dynamic model present well matching with the system. Finally, the VSC tracking control based on the minimum IAEE trajectory is realized and its robustness and energy-saving performance is demonstrated simultaneously. The proposed methodology to design the minimum IAEE trajectory can also be applied to any other mechatronic system driven by a PMSM.",

		"abstract": "In this work, we consider a multi-wheeled payload transport system. Each of the wheels can be selectively actuated. When they are not actuated, wheels are free moving and do not consume battery power. The payload transport system is modeled as an actuated multi-agent system, with each wheel-motor pair as an agent. Kinematic and dynamic models are developed to ensure that the payload transport system moves as desired. We design optimization formulations to decide on the number of wheels to be active and which of the wheels to be active so that the battery is conserved and the wear on the motors is reduced. Our multi-level control framework over the agents ensures that near-optimal number of agents is active for the payload transport system to function. Through simulation studies we show that our solution ensures energy efficient operation and increases the distance traveled by the payload transport system, for the same battery power. We have built the payload transport system and provide results for preliminary experimental validation.",

		"abstract": "In this study, a general type-2 fractional order fuzzy PID (GT2FO-FPID) controller is proposed to fulfil the balance adjustment of the Power-line Inspection (PLI) robot system. It is a combination of Mamdani general type-2 fuzzy logic controller (GT2-FLC) and fractional PID controller. Since the PLI robot system is an under-actuated system, it&rsquo;s necessary to get complete information of the system. However, when all state variables are treated as input to the controller, there is a problem with the rule explosion. Because of this, the information fusion method is adopt to solve the problem and simplify the controller design. At the same time, fractional-order integral-differential operators and input-output scaling factors, which are taken as design variables and optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). To assess the performance of proposed controller based on symmetry criterion, we compared it against existing controllers, i.e., interval type-2 fractional order fuzzy PID (IT2FO-FPID), type-1 fractional order fuzzy PID (T1FO-FPID), and conventional fractional order (FOPID) controllers. Furthermore, to show the anti-inference ability of the proposed controller, three common perturbed process are tested. Finally, simulation results show that the GT2FO-FPID controller outperforms other controllers in the presence of external perturbations on the PLI robot system.",

		"abstract": "Based on the two-degree-of-freedom planar link topology, this paper deduces that five-bar mechanism is the simplest structure to realize the closed chain mechanism. After discussing the five-bar mechanism, it was found that a variant of the RPRPR structure could be used as the basic linkage group of the new closed chain leg mechanism and named as collinear driver mechanism. This paper establishes 3D model of the hexapod robot equipped with the collinear driver leg mechanism and the ordinary distributed leg mechanism, and imports them into the ADAMS for dynamic simulation. The collinear driver mechanism is used as a design scheme, and the distributed driver is used as a comparison scheme in order to verify whether the collinear driver mechanism is superior to the existing distributed driver mechanism in terms of energy consumption and dynamic parameters. From the comparison of the simulation results, it is found that the energy consumption of the collinear driver mechanism is significantly smaller than that of the distributed driver mechanism, which proves that it is a new design with low energy consumption in the closed chain leg mechanism. In addition, the distributed driver decoupling mechanism has high requirements on the peak power of the driver, and set the higher requirement of the joint drivers. The collinear driver decoupling mechanism allows the two drivers to work together.",

		"abstract": "Due to the ever increasing number of industrial robots in the world, working day and night producing and manufacturing, a need has arisen to make sure that these robots work energy efficient. This is both to make robots cost effective for businesses and environmentally friendly.\n\nDuring the course of this thesis a method for planning an energy efficient velocity profile for an ABB IRB 1600 robot has been developed. This method does not only look at the assignment of velocity and acceleration along a path, but also the gain of energy efficiency that optimizing the position and orientation of a manipulation task have.\n\nThe result of this method shows that the optimal position and orientation gives a minimization of the movement of the second joint, and that at this optimal position the gain in energy efficiency of the optimal orientation is 161.1% from the horizontal plane. The optimal trajectory also have a 16.3% smaller energy consumption than a trajectory made by ABBs own motion planner in the optimal plane. Thus, the work done in this thesis optimize energy in two ways. \n\nExperiments were also performed to find the maximum and minimum torque for the first three joints of the robot. This was supposed to be used when constraining acceleration and jerk. These constraints were however excluded from the optimization scheme as the energy efficient trajectories obtained were nowhere close to the torque bounds. These experimental results are however greatly of interest when looking at time-optimal trajectories, and can be reused for this purpose.",

		"abstract": "The problem of nonlinear identification and energy conservative control of balance in a monopod is addressed in this chapter. A monopod is emulated using a concave balancing mechanism, referred to as the body, mounted on an inverted pendulum, referred to as the leg, via a hip joint. The body curvature, represented by ϕ, can be altered and is elected as the design parameter of interest as it is observed that at an optimal body span angle, ϕopt, certain interesting phenomena transpire: The linearized system is transformed from nonminimum to minimum phase (MP), the conditions for feedback linearization of the nonlinear model satisfied, and minimal mechanical power required for stability of the simulated model is observed. A nonlinear gray-box system identification routine is developed and implemented within MATLAB, to estimate certain immeasurable parameters that arise within the original system dynamics. To estimate the optimal angle ϕopt, another immeasurable parameter, the identification routine is further employed for various values of ϕ. A locus of the transfer function zeros is then used to interpolate the value of ϕ at which the system achieves MP behavior. At this configuration, the magnitude of the transfer function zeros become much larger in comparison with that of the largest pole and, therefore, has a negligible contribution to the phase characteristics of the system. After the experimental identification of ϕopt, a Linear Quadratic Regulator with integral action is design and implemented to achieve the control objectives, with the design parameters set as close as physically realizable to the optimal setting. A nonlinear controller based on Feedback Linearization is also designed and implemented to take advantage of one benefit of this proposed design. The performance of the nonlinear controller is also compared against that of the LQ Regulator. Analysis and documentation of the power savings from the proposed design, in relation to existing prototypes, is a subject of further works. Furthermore, the performance of the developed controllers can be further improved via careful tuning to meet more stringent control objectives.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents a systematic methodology for on-site identification and optimal path planning of an industrial robot. The identification experiments are carried out on-site, in a quick, non-invasive way using an CA8335 Qualistar three-phase electrical networks analyser. Next, the collected data is used in an optimization routine that minimizes the Root-Mean-Square error between the experimentally collected torques and the expected torques coming from the parametric dynamic model (including the inertias, the centres of gravity and the Coulomb and viscous friction coefficients). The optimization routine results the specification of a representative dynamic robot model. This dynamic robot model is inserted as a dynamic constraint into an optimal control problem, where other physical constraint are added i.e. the limited workspace, the joint velocities and acceleration constraints. A non-linear optimization using sequential quadratic solver is used to minimize a cost function based on the execution time or the energy consumption. The resulting time or energy optimal path is translated into custom robot commands. The systematic methodology is validated on an IRB1600 industrial ABB robot performing a custom pick-and-place operation. The obtained dynamic robot model is given and compared to the collected measurements. To demonstrate the possibility of energy saving by ’intelligently’ programming a robot trajectory the energy and time optimal path are generated taking all physical constraints into account. Preliminary results show a significant time and energy improvement (up to 10 %) compared to the trajectories generated by the ABB software.",

		"abstract": "In cyclic scheduling of material handling robots in manufacturing cells, a common approach is to minimize the cycle time objective, which is a measure of the throughput of the cell. In a typical robot move cycle, robot move times constitute a significant portion of the cycle time. During handling operations, robots consume significant amount of energy, which is determined by their speed, load and the distance they travel. In this paper, we propose considering robot speed decisions along with robot move sequencing decisions in a robotic cell scheduling problem. We study the trade-off between the cycle time and the energy consumption of a robot in a robotic cell which produces identical parts. In this cell, the robot loads and unloads the machines. Each machine performs a different operation on a part and the robot moves linearly along a track. We provide models to find efficient solutions for cycle time and robot energy consumption objectives in an m-machine robotic cell. In a case study for two machine robotic cell, we show that robot speed control can lead to significant savings in energy consumption.",

		"abstract": "The primary goal of this work is the theoretical and experimental development of micro and mini systems for the photovoltaic production and the energy storage. \r\nRobotics platforms should be, as much as possible, autonomous and self-sufficient, also from the energetic point of view. To this aim, up to now, the best compromise appears to be the use of micro solar power systems with rechargeable batteries. The use of this strategy for supplying systems with limited size and mass, but nevertheless high power requirements, such as a mobile robot, has been first studied. The system taken as test-bed in the experiment is a bio-inspired mobile robot, called TriBot. \r\nFirst of all, a preliminary analysis of the feasibility of a photovoltaic system with batteries to supply this mobile robot has been done, considering the different solutions to place the PV cells on the robot structure, the different photovoltaic technologies and the power consumption of the robot, the conclusion is that, using the photovoltaic system here proposed, it is possible to increase the autonomy of the robot.\r\nSince in the PV system here analyzed few solar cells can be employed, a very efficient charging system is an essential requisite. To this aim, a novel photovoltaic charge regulator, which uses the Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage MPPT method, is proposed. \r\nA typical stand-alone photovoltaic system includes a solar array, batteries, regulator and load. In order to model the whole system and to evaluate its performance, a Simulink model in Matlab environment has been developed. In the simulator, measured values of the radiation and the temperature have been used, Anyhow, it will be possible also to use predicted values of radiation and temperature.  \r\nIn this work, data given us by a weather forecast provider have been used. First of all the accuracy of these predicted data have been determined. Then, a method to classify each minute of a day as variable, cloudy, slightly cloudy or clear has been implemented. Using a neural network, a correlation between the classification of a specific day and the error done has been found. The knowledge of the available energy, in fact, should allow to implement power saving strategies, optimizing the activities of the robot. \r\nForecast and measured solar radiation are relative to the horizontal plane. However, the PV panel exposition is not assumed to be a control variable due to the fact that the robot can change its posture operating on uneven terrains. For these reasons, models are required to estimate the solar radiation on the plane of the PV array starting from the radiation on the horizontal plane. To this aim, Perez and Klucher models have been developed, these models require information at the same time on the global and the direct or diffuse radiation on the horizontal surface. Moreover, a neural network that allows to evaluate the global solar radiation on the tilted surface directly from the global solar radiation measured on the horizontal plane, without the need to slit it into the direct and diffuse components, has been developed.\r\nOnce that the solar radiation, measured or forecast, at any inclination and orientation are estimated; the power consumption of the robot and the efficiency of the charge regulator are known, all these information can be used in the Simulink model that, therefore, can become a very helpful tool to estimate the power production of the photovoltaic system and therefore the increase of the autonomy of the embedded systems used as load.",
