This paper emphatically describes the structural design, the robot control system design and the results of navigation experiment. The experiment shows that this robot can track a signal wire well which is set on the ground for navigation, and it obtains a nice steering ability even for short turns with the speed less than 0.5 m/s.

For vehicles operating at low speeds on hard, flat surfaces, kinematic models utilizing the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of the tracks or wheels of a skid-steer vehicle have been shown to provide accurate motion and power use estimation. Previous work has relied on post-process optimization to learn necessary ICR location and terrain information for motion and power modeling. The work presented here utilizes an extended Kalman filter for learning ICR locations and the recursive least squares algorithm for learning terrain-related power model parameters. The algorithms have been implemented on a wheeled skid-steer vehicle, and field test results show good estimation of motion and power usage using no prior terrain information and only knowledge of vehicle geometry and mass distribution, intermittent GPS and heading, and odometry information from the slipping tires/treads.",skid-steer robot power usage estimation,skid-steer vehicle tracks,skid-steer vehicle wheels,slip,slipping tires,slipping treads,steering systems,terrain-related power model parameters,vehicle geometry,vehicle motion,vehicles speeds,wheeled skid-steer vehicle,wheels,Wheels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high level corresponds to an input-output linearization control for the mechanical structure; the medium level is based on two sensorless controls designed via differential flatness for the actuators; and the low level is related to two cascade controls based on sliding modes and PI control for the power stage.

Recently, anthropomorphic LEE solutions have gained wide spread interest to remedy the interference issues encountered at the human-robot interface. In that context, this paper presents a multi-degrees of freedom modular power-assist LEE robot with compatible joint axes to enhance kinematic compliance. The proposed LEE, named Anthro-X, supports all three DoF at the hip joint using a novel articulated mechanism. The polycentric motion of the knee joint is also facilitated using a unique mechanism based on four-bar linkage system. In total, Anthro-X has five DoF per limb where sagittal plane motions of hip and knee joints are powered by external power supply and others are passively supported. The prototype of the proposed LEE robot was fitted on a male subject to verify the kinematic conformity of hip and knee joint mechanisms. Experiments were then conducted to evaluate the effects of providing power assistance using Anthro-X during squatting exercises. Results indicate that the proposed design can be readily adapted for wide range of applications requiring motion or power assistance owing to its modular and anthropomorphic architecture.",multidegre-of-freedom modular power-assist LEE robot,power assistance,sagittal plane motions,squatting exercises,wearable devices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods A consecutive cohort of 436 rectal cancer patients who underwent curative RA SSOs were prospectively enrolled during 2010–2014, including 123 patients with ICG imaging (ICG+ group) and 313 patients without ICG imaging (ICG– group). Results ICG imaging appeared to be helpful in identifying competent perfusion of the bowel adjacent to the anastomosis in 13 patients (10.6%) who might be susceptible to bowel ischaemia, including restrictive mesocolon. AL was remarkably greater in the ICG– group compared with the ICG+ group (5.4% vs 0.8%; p = 0.031). Conclusions ICG imaging during RA SSO provides accurate real-time knowledge of the perfusion status at or near the anastomosis, specifically reducing AL in patients who may incur bowel ischaemia.

Bilateral arm training (BAT) has shown promise in expediting progress toward upper limb recovery in chronic stroke patients, but its neural correlates are poorly understood. Objective. To evaluate changes in upper limb function and EEG power after a robot-assisted BAT in chronic stroke patients. Methods. In a within-subject design, seven right-handed chronic stroke patients with upper limb paresis received 21 sessions (3 days/week) of the robot-assisted BAT. The outcomes were changes in score on the upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM), Motricity Index (MI), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) evaluated at the baseline (T0), posttraining (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2). Event-related desynchronization/synchronization were calculated in the upper alpha and the beta frequency ranges. Results. Significant improvement in all outcomes was measured over the course of the study. Changes in FM were significant at T2, and in MAS at T1 and T2. After training, desynchronization on the ipsilesional sensorimotor areas increased during passive and active movement, as compared with T0. Conclusions. A repetitive robotic-assisted BAT program may improve upper limb motor function and reduce spasticity in the chronically impaired paretic arm.

However, root cause of reduced heaviness and factors affecting the heaviness are still unclear though the knowledge on the root cause/factors could be used to modulate human's feelings and the interactions between human and robot. This paper investigated the causes/factors behind the reduced heaviness. We adopted two strategies for this. Firstly, we included weight perception in robot dynamics (and control) in such a way that the mass parameter of the inertial force was considered different from that of the gravitational force because the perceived weight is different from the actual weight. Secondly, we compared weight perception, load forces and motions for power-assisted manipulation to that for manual manipulation and identified some clues regarding the causes/factors of reduced heaviness. We found that perceived weight, load force and its rate, velocity and acceleration for power-assisted objects were lower than that for manually lifted objects. We observed time delays in position sensing, force sensing, servomotor etc. for the power-assisted objects, however, the delays were almost absent for the manually lifted objects. We argued that the delays were the root cause of reduced heaviness and the elements of the system contributing to the delays were the factors affecting the perceived heaviness. To cross-check it, we increased time constant of the servomotor and found that the increased time constant reduced perceived weight. The findings may be used to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that may help improve/modulate interactions between robots and users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper analyzes two dynamic modeling methods for a jumping robot via the energy conversion principle. The robot uses a compliant link to jump by storing kinetic energy as potential energy in elastic deflection. Linear and torsion-based dynamic models were developed, and the torsion-based model uses a pseudo-rigid-body model.

For industrial processes addressing heating and cooling as well as material transformation, a wide range of energy efficiency measures have been developed and successfully implemented. In contrast to that, most robot-based operations such as pick-and-place motions or assembly tasks still use inefficient standard concepts causing high-energy consumption and high-energy costs. Thanks to a rather low payload-to-weight ratio of new robot designs, such as parallel kinematic or hybrid robot manipulators, a high potential for energy savings is expected. This article identifies potentials for energy saving concerning industrial consumers by assessing three different robot concepts. Based on a literature review, two existing designs for robots – the conventional serial robot and the parallel kinematic robot are analysed and compared with respect to the energy utilised during a typical item placement task. Afterwards, the concept of PARAGRIP, a hybrid of the two presented robot designs is introduced and examined based on simulation regarding its energy consumption.

Since social robots present a new type of social agent, they have been aptly classified as a disruptive technology, i.e. the sort of technology which affects the core of our current social practices and might lead to profound cultural and social change. Due to its disruptive and innovative potential, social robotics raises not only questions about utility, ethics, and legal aspects, but calls for “robo-philosophy” – the comprehensive philosophical reflection from the perspectives of all philosophical disciplines. This book presents the proceedings of the first conference in this new area, “Robo-Philosophy 2014 – Sociable Robots and the Future of Social Relations, held in Aarhus, Denmark, in August 2014. The short papers and abstracts collected here address questions of social robotics from the perspectives of philosophy of mind, social ontology, ethics, meta-ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, intercultural philosophy, and metaphilosophy. Social robotics is still in its early stages, but it is precisely now that we need to reflect its possible cultural repercussions. This book is accessible to a wide readership and will be of interest to everyone involved in the development and use of social robotics applications, from social roboticists to policy makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-61499-480-0,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was described to facilitate selective clamping during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN).
Objective
To perform a systematic review and cumulative analysis of available studies comparing the outcomes of RAPN with or without use of this technology (NIRF).
Evidence acquisition
A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify relevant studies up to December 2018 through PubMed and EMBASE databases. A meta-analysis was conducted with the RevMan 5.3 software.
Evidence synthesis
Six comparative studies were identified. Overall, 369 cases were included for the analysis (171 NIRF-RAPN and 198 standard RAPN). No significant difference was identified between groups in baseline characteristics, operating time, and estimated blood loss; however, a shorter clamping time was recorded for the NIRF-RAPN group. Functional outcomes revealed higher overall estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in the NIRF-RAPN group at short-term (1–3 mo) postoperative follow-up (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 9.26ml/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.46, 12.06; p<0.001). In two studies, a renal scan-based assessment of split eGFR was available, and pooled analysis revealed higher split eGFR for NIRF-RAPN (WMD: 7.91ml/min; 95% CI: 4.26, 11.56; p < 0.001), and lower Δ % between preoperative and 1-mo eGFR (WMD: −7.84%; 95% CI: −8.85, −6.83; p<0.00001).
Conclusions
Current evidence regarding the use of NIRF-guided selective clamping during RAPN is based on a limited number of studies from high-volume institutions. Notwithstanding these limitations, NIRF-RAPN can be safely performed, and it might offer better short-term renal functional outcomes. It remains to be determined whether this can ultimately translate into a clinical benefit for patients undergoing RAPN, especially in the long term.
Patient summary
We assessed the outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) performed with or without the use of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. NIRF-RAPN appeared to be a safe procedure with potential better short-term functional outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240545691930080X,2020-03-27 13:26:05,2405-4569,,,en,,European Urology Focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a novel methodology for trajectory and coordination optimisation of cyclic multi-robot systems. Both velocity tuning and time delays are used to coordinate the robots that operate in close proximity and avoid collisions. The novel element is the non-linear programming optimisation model that directly co-adjusts the multi-robot coordination during the trajectory optimisation, which allows optimising these as one problem. The methodology is demonstrated for productivity/smoothness optimisation, and for energy efficiency optimisation. An experimental validation is done for a real-world case study that considers the multi-robot material handling system of a multi-stage tandem press line. The results show that the productivity optimisation with the methodology is competitive compared to previous research and that substantial improvements can be achieved, e.g. up to 50% smoother trajectories and 14% reduction in energy consumption for the same productivity.

More importantly, Moball incorporates an internal triaxial set of linear electromagnetic generators which can be used to harvest wind energy for long-duration self-sustained operation, or to bias its' wind-driven motions as a form of steering. This paper describes our process to optimize the design of a coreless tubular linear generator for Moball so as to improve energy generation and motion control capabilities with the minimal moving generator mass. The performance of three different types of movers was analyzed with the help of finite element analysis. We determined a final optimized structure and its' dimensions involving a single dipole PM and novel slope-shaped back-irons. A prototype of a single-axis linear generator with a length of 0.8 m was fabricated and assembled. Drop and rotating tests were performed to measure the generated power with this machine. The maximum generated power in the rotating test was 1.05 W at 19 rpm when the load resistance was 40 Ω. The experimental results agreed well with our model predictions. The paper concludes with an overview of the current Moball prototype and ongoing work. The design process developed in this paper can serve as a guideline for future design of energy scavenging systems for robots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system was simulated and two humans cooperatively lifted objects with it. We analyzed human features such as weight perception, load forces, motions etc. We found that the robot reduced the perceived weights to 25% of the actual weights, and the load forces were 8 times larger than the actual requirements. The excessive load forces resulted in excessive accelerations that jeopardized the performances. We then implemented a novel control based on the human features, which was such that a virtual mass exponentially declined from a large value to a small one when subjects lifted objects with the robot and the command velocity exceeded a threshold. The novel control reduced excessive load forces and accelerations and thus enhanced performances in terms of maneuverability, safety etc. The findings may be used to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that may augment human's abilities and skills and may improve interactions between robots and users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5772/50894,2020-03-27 13:28:56,1729-8814,,,en,,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model can then be solved to optimality using mathematical programming. We have previously shown proof of concept for this energy reduction method. In this paper, we apply state of the art MINLP methods to a number of problems in order benchmark their effectiveness. Algorithms used are Nonlinear Programming based Branch and Bound (NLP-BB), Outer Approximation (OA), LP/NLP based Branch and Bound (LP/NLP-BB) and Extended Cutting Plane (ECP). Benchmarks show that the NLP-BB does not perform well for nonlinear scheduling problems. This is due to the weak lower bounds of the integer relaxations. For scheduling problems with nonlinear costs, ECP and in particular LP/NLP-BB are shown to outperform both NLP-BB and OA.

Based on locomotion data, springs are designed and substantial reductions in power consumption are demonstrated using a bench dynamometer.

Featuring high-torque brushless DC motors, efficient low-ratio transmissions, and high-fidelity torque control, STEPPR provides the ability to incorporate novel joint-level mechanisms without dramatically altering high-level control. Unique parallel elastic designs are incorporated into STEPPR, and walking data show that hip adduction and ankle flexion springs significantly reduce the required actuator energy at those joints for several gaits.

        OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide interpretative guidelines for indocyanine green fluorescent imaging through quantitative analysis and to suggest possible indications for indocyanine green fluorescent imaging during robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations.
        DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study.
        SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a single center.
        PATIENTS: A cohort of 657 patients with rectal cancer who consecutively underwent curative robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations was enrolled between 2010 and 2016, including 310 patients with indocyanine green imaging (indocyanine green fluorescent imaging+ group) and 347 patients without indocyanine green imaging (indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group).
        MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We tried to quantitatively define the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging findings based on perfusion (mesocolic and colic) time and perfusion intensity (5 grades) to provide probable indications.
        RESULTS: The anastomotic leakage rate was significantly lower in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging+ group than in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group (0.6% vs 5.2%) (OR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.028–0.544; p = 0.006). Anastomotic stricture was closely correlated with anastomotic leakage (p = 0.002) and a short descending mesocolon (p = 0.003). Delayed perfusion (>60 s) and low perfusion intensity (1–2) were more frequently detected in patients with anastomotic stricture and marginal artery defects than in those without these factors (p ≤ 0.001). In addition, perfusion times greater than the mean were more frequently observed in patients aged >58 years, whereas low perfusion intensity was seen more in patients with short descending mesocolon and high ASA classes (≥3).
        LIMITATIONS: The 300 patients in the indocyanine green fluorescent imaging− group underwent operations 3 years before indocyanine green fluorescent imaging.
        CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of indocyanine green fluorescent imaging may help prevent anastomotic complications during robot-assisted sphincter-saving operations, and may be of particular value in high-class ASA patients, older patients, and patients with a short descending mesocolon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/Abstract/2017/04000/Interpretative_Guidelines_and_Possible_Indications.5.aspx,2020-03-27 13:30:11,0012-3706,,,en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we present the energy based nonlinear control method to control the swing manner of brachiation, and a feed back control law is designed using the Lyapunov stability theory. The target brachiation is an effective locomotion from one bar to another by exchanging kinetic energy with potential energy like a pendulum, which the same as the real long armed ape uses. Finally the experimental results on a 2-link-model brachiation robot show feasibility of the developed controller design scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human upper-limb has 7 degrees of freedom to achieve various tasks dexterously. Therefore, to assist all upper-limb joint motions of a human, the upper-limb power-assist robot is required to have 7DOF. On the other hand, to achieve a desired task, a person moves own hand to the desired position and orientation. For this reason, the hand position or hand force must be focused to be controlled by the upper-limb power-assist robots. However, the hand position or hand force is 6-dimensional vector, so the 7DOF upper-limb power-assist robot has a redundancy and in general, a pseudo-inverse matrix is used in the control. In this paper, the torque optimization for an upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton robot using the pseudo-inverse matrix is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by the experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assist daily motion of the physically weak persons, the robot must estimate the motion intention of the user in real-time. Although there are several kinds of method to estimate the motion intention of the user in real-time, Electromyogram (EMG) signals are often used to estimate that since they reflect the users muscle activities. However, EMG-based real-time motion estimation is not very easy because of several reasons. In this chapter, an EMG-based control method is introduced to control the power-assist lower-limb exoskeleton robot in accordance with users motion intention. A neuro-fuzzy modifier is applied to deal with those problems. The problems of EMG-based motion estimation are cleared by applying the neuro-fuzzy modifier.Sometimes there is a problem in the users motion even though the users motion is assisted, if the user misunderstands interaction between the users motion and a surrounding environment. In that case, the users motion should be modified to avoid an accident. In this chapter, a method of perception-assist is also introduced to automatically modify the users motion properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12922-8_14,2020-03-27 13:31:05,978-3-319-12922-8,,,en,,,"Mohammed, Samer","Moreno, Juan C.",Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics,Cham,,,"Kong, Kyoungchul","Amirat, Yacine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike workers in the Global North who experienced automation in the 1960s and 1970s against a backdrop of strong union activism, whether semi-proletarian peasant-workers in China ultimately enjoy the ‘beneficial’ effects of industrial upgrading is questionable. However, very little social science research has investigated how automation, in light of the negative consequences of unemployment and deskilling, can continue to be advanced.

The robot possesses only one actuator per leg, for lower weight and greater power autonomy. The developed mechanism ensures correct dispersion of energy to the actuated and the unactuated degrees of freedom of the robot for stable running. In the mechanism design, we address the added problem of running on inclined ground. In conjunction with a pitch control method, the energy transfer mechanism forms a complete control algorithm. Due to the novel dynamics-based design of the mechanism, it allows the arbitrary setting of the motion forward speed and apex height. Further, it may be applied for different robot physical parameters and ground inclines, without extensive controller tuning. This has not been previously possible using only one actuator per leg. Simulations of a detailed three-dimensional model of the robot demonstrate the mechanism on two different robots. The simulations take into account many real-world characteristics, including realistic leg models, energy loss due to feet collisions, foot–ground friction and energy losses in the joints.

It has been proved that bilateral arm exercise can stimulate ipsilateral corticospinal pathways and enhance recovery; also the coordination of the two limbs can reduce hypertonia and abnormal synergies compared to unilateral limb training. In conventional bilateral arm training robots, the healthy limb provides a reference movement and the robot gives an assistant force for the impaired limb to implement mirror image movements, or the healthy limb assists the impaired limb to accomplish the desired movement, whereas no resistant force was supplied for patients with the healthy limb to perform strength enhancement training. This paper introduces a novel master- slave rehabilitation robot to implement bilateral arm coordinated training. The robot supports passive, active-assisted, and active-constrained training modes. No matter in which mode, the corresponding force provided for the impaired limb is from the healthy limb. A prototype was developed with two identical motors. A subject controls the two motors with his/her two limbs to accomplish desired movements.

Using these signatures means an overhead of the transmitted data but increases the interference resistance and the reliability of the communication.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the cause-effect analyses enabled by total EE, which is lumped over a time duration and all system degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), are limited. In this study, robotic gait energetics is evaluated through a DOF-based instrumentation system designed for instantaneous evaluation of bidirectional current and applied voltage at each joint actuator. The instrumentation system includes a dual-module arrangement of buffers and attenuators, and accommodates and synchronizes the voltage and current measurements from multiple actuators. For illustrative purposes, this system is implemented at each DC servomotor in a biped robot, DARwIn-OP, to analyze the electrical EE rates for walking at various speeds. In addition, a DOF-based model of instantaneous human EE rate is employed to enable quantitative characterization of robotic walking EE relative to that of humans. The robot's instantaneous lower-body EE rates are consistent with its periodic walking cycle, and their relative trends between single and double support phases are analogous to those of humans. The robotic cost of transport (COT) curve as a function of normalized speed is also consistent with the human COT in terms of its convexity. Conversely, the contrasting distributions of EE throughout the robot and human DOFs and the robotic COT curve's considerably larger magnitudes, smaller speed ranges, and higher sensitivity to speed illustrate the energetic consequences of stable but inefficient static walking in the biped robot relative to the more efficient dynamic walking of humans. These energetic characteristics enable the identification of the joints and gait cycle phases associated with inefficiency in biped robotic gait, and reflect the noticeable differences in the system parameters (rigid and flat versus segmented feet) and gait control strategies (bent versus straight knees, instants of peak ankle actuator torques, static versus dynamic balance stability). The proposed general instrumentation provides a quantitative approach to benchmarking human gait as well as general guidelines for the development of energy-efficient walking robots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/robotica/article/energy-expenditure-of-a-biped-walking-robot-instantaneous-and-degreeoffreedombased-instrumentation-with-human-gait-implications/748F7A69881B87316931A50E83C69DC3,2020-03-27 13:46:46,"0263-5747, 1469-8668",,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multi-goal motion planning problem has been solved as a mixed-integer optimal control problem in which, given the dynamic model of the robot manipulator, the initial and final configurations of the robot, and a set of waypoints inside the workspace of the manipulator, one has to find the control inputs, the sequence of waypoints with the corresponding passage times, and the resulting trajectory of the robot that minimizes the energy consumption during the motion. The presence of the waypoint constraints makes this optimal control problem particularly difficult to solve. The mixed-integer optimal control problem has been converted into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem first making the unknown passage times through the waypoints part of the state, then introducing binary variables to enforce the constraint of passing once through each waypoint, and finally applying a fifth-degree Gauss–Lobatto direct collocation method to tackle the dynamic constraints. High-degree interpolation polynomials allow the number of variables of the problem to be reduced for a given numerical precision.

Video capsule endoscopy is a useful tool for noninvasive intestinal detection, but it is not capable of active movement; wireless power is an effective solution to this problem.
Methods
The research in this paper consists of two parts: the mechanical structure which enables the robot to move smoothly inside the intestinal tract, and the wireless power supply which ensures efficiency. First, an intestinal robot with leg architectures was developed based on the Archimedes spiral, which mimics the movement of an inchworm. The spiral legs were capable of unfolding to an angle of approximately 155°, which guaranteed stability of clamping, consistency of surface pressure, and avoided the risk of puncturing the intestinal tract. Secondly, the necessary power to operate the robot was far beyond the capacity of button batteries, so a wireless power transmission (WPT) platform was developed. The design of the platform focused on power transfer efficiency and frequency stability. In addition, the safety of human tissue in the alternating electromagnetic field was also taken into consideration. Finally, the assembled robot was tested and verified with the use of the WPT platform.
Results
In the isolated intestine, the robot system successfully traveled along the intestine with an average speed of 23mm per minute. The obtained videos displayed a resolution of 320×240 and a transmission rate of 30 frames per second. The WPT platform supplied up to 500mW of energy to the robot, and achieved a power transfer efficiency of 12%.
Conclusion
It has been experimentally verified that the intestinal robot is safe and effective as an endoscopy tool, for which wireless power is feasible. Proposals for further improving the robot and wireless power supply are provided later in this paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482515002036,2020-03-27 13:49:14,0010-4825,,,en,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But they are not capable of coping with the disaster yet. The main reasons are the lack of bipedal walking technology on uneven terrain and short operating time due to low energy efficiency during walking. In the case of the existing bipedal walking robot which is driven by actuators in each joint, energy efficiency is poor because moment of inertia and mass are high due to heavy actuators located far from the rotational axis. To solve this problem, this paper suggests the six degree-of-freedom robot leg using the four-bar linkage mechanism with high rigidity. The actuator of the knee joint and ankle joint are positioned on the hip to reduce the leg mass and moment of inertia. Our aim is bipedal walking robot lower body design to increase the energy efficiency and walk on highspeed. To do so, we designed the robot lower body that has optimal dimension to endure external forces with minimum mass. And we simulated the result of each joint trajectory, torque and energy efficiency based on the designed model to generate a walking pattern.

We hold that in addition to basic emotions such as anger and fear that serves bodily well being of the organism, high level emotions such as boredom and affection have evolved to facilitate low cost brain computations. Higher level of emotions can be considered as affective state of the organism or mood, rather than the reflex-like physiologically triggered emotional responses such as fear and anger. In large and complex brains (e.g. primate brains), the neuronal energy consumption for cognition is non-negligible. We propose that for such organisms computational regulatory mechanisms for decision making give rise to behaviors that can be explained by various emotional states. As a proof of concept for this idea, we envision a robotic cognitive system and a select function that we assign a neural cost for its operation. To be concrete, we use a small humanoid robot platform (Darwin-OP) and implement a neural network (Hopfield Network) that allows the robot to recall learned patterns that it sees through its camera. As a model of neural computational energy consumption, we postulate that a change in the state of a neural unit of the network consumes one unit of (neural) energy. Therefore, the total computational energy consumed is determined by the incoming stimuli. The robot is programmed to avoid high energy consumption by showing aversive behavior when the energy consumption is high. Otherwise, the robot demonstrates engaging behavior. For an external observer these responses may be perceived as robot's having certain emotional (affectional) preference for input stimuli. In this article in addition to robot experiments, we also emphasize the biological support for our proposal and provide detailed exposition of biological background and its relevance for the hypothesis that (certain) emotions may emerge through computational mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a balancing strategy for hopping humanoid robots against various magnitude of disturbance. The proposed balancing strategy for a hopping humanoid robot consists of two controllers, the posture balance controller and the landing position controller. The posture balance controller is used for small disturbances, and its role is to maintain stability by controlling the ankle torque of the robot. On the other hand, if disturbance is large, the landing position controller, which changes the landing position of the swing foot, works with the posture balance controller simultaneously. In this way, the landing position controller reduces large disturbances, and the posture balance controller controls the remaining disturbances. The landing position controller is derived by the principle of energy conservation. An experiment conducted with a real humanoid robot, HUBO2, verifies the proposed method. HUBO2 made a stable and continuous hopping action with the proposed balancing strategy overcoming various disturbances placed in the way of the robot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219843613500205,2020-03-27 13:50:58,0219-8436,,,,,Int.

The long-term ubiquitous operation of robots hinges on smart energy consumption and the replenishment of the robots. This paper provides a heuristic method for planning missions that extend over multiple battery lives of working robots. This method simultaneously generates energy efficient trajectories for multiple robots, and schedules energy cycling using static charging stations through the mission. The mission planning algorithm accounts for environmental obstacles, current, and can adapt to a priority search distribution. The simulation results for a scenario similar to the MH370 airplane search mission demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm in area coverage and handling environmental constraints.

However, Minitaur is challenged by long-distance locomotion on sand dunes. Previous simulation results [5] suggested that the energetic cost of transport can be mitigated by programming a virtual damping force to slow the intrusion of a Minitaur foot into simulated granular media following a bulk-behavior force law [6].

The new emulator allows us to corroborate the conclusions of our previous simulation with physical hopping experiments.

However, considering the delay constraint, the extra costs of data transmission and remote computation, it is not trivial to make optimized offloading decisions. In particular, task offloading for robots is more complex due to their on-demand mobility and network connectivity that significantly influence the robot–cloud communication links. Moreover, for multi-robot systems, a suitable balance of workload between local network (robot–robot) and global cloud (robot–cloud) is also required, so as to attain proper utilization of resources. Therefore, it is essential to establish more comprehensive offloading schemes for modeling systems that can handle these higher level of complications. With that view, this paper aims to develop a novel multi-layer decision-making scheme for task offloading which jointly considers the following four aspects: (i) selection of task for offloading, (ii) selection of robot to offload a task, (iii) selection of location to offload/perform task, (iv) selection of access point for offloaded task. An integrated framework for cloud networked multi-robot systems is presented to enable our task offloading scheme where the primary robot can aid from additional local robots to improve the offloading process. In particular, we consider a warehouse scenario with 36 cell workspace where a 40 node taskflow is motivated from a “parcel sorting and distribution” application, to be completed by the primary robot. The offloading decision for each task is formulated as part of a joint optimization problem and it is solved by developing a multi-layer genetic algorithm scheme that takes into account motion, network connectivity and local sharing for its offloading decisions.

We then simulated the system using MATLAB/SIMULINK and lifted different sizes of objects with the system. We analyzed human's perceived weights as well as load force characteristics for lifting objects with the system.

Multi-robot systems are more likely to accomplish complicated tasks while providing efficiency and reliability compared to a single robot. Conserving energy of the robots is also important so that the robots could accomplish more tasks with the constraint of the battery capacity. Research of robotics allow one to realise that some human functions can be applied to a robot. An example would be a person walking along a path. It is an involuntary reaction that a person aim to walk anywhere along the path as long as one stay on the path. It could be seen that the goal position is actually a region instead of a specific point. In addition, one would use his eyes to look for any incoming object to change his path direction to avoid collision. These could all be applied on the robots where the robots would run in a region and using sensors to avoid collision when running in a group. The robots are set to run with conventional trajectory and region trajectory. Conventional trajectory is a traditional method for the robot to the goal position by going to a specific point. Region trajectory control can be visualised as robot travelling within a defined playing field. The robot can travel anywhere within the defined region. The author also set different robot formation to run within the designated region. In order to for multi-robots to run in an orderly manner, a certain pattern need to be considered. In this project, it is required to find out if the robot formation is a factor for energy consumption. This project focus on power consumption of the robots. As the robots are battery-powered, energy measurements would be taken using a power analyser while running the trajectories. Energy consumption will be calculated with the current and voltage values from the power analyser. Energy comparison will be make for different robot formations for different trajectories. There are some constraints faced due to the nature of the robot and the software thus it is necessary to maximize the utility of the robot to meet the goals and also to save on power consumption.In conclusion, a multi-robot system is particularly useful for completing tasks without much supervision. More power-saving controllers could be researched and developed to allow robots to run for a longer time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/64196,2020-03-27 14:17:27,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a case study, we discuss the potential of Evolutionary Operation (EVOP) derived methods. The case study relates to a badminton robot that has to perform point-to-point motions during a fixed time interval, based on two operation modes: time-optimal motion, which ensures maximum precision but highest energy consumption, and energy-optimal motion, which decreases the energy consumption, but as a trade-off also lowers the precision. The current standard mode of operation is the energy-optimal mode that is constructed from off-line optimization on simulations. An online EVOP steepest ascent optimization to further reduce the energy consumption by fine-tuning the implemented energy-optimal mode was implemented. The constrained nature of the problem, where energy needs to be minimized subject to a time constraint, was transformed to an unconstrained single-objective optimization using Derringer desirability functions. Two important contributions were made: (i) the online optimization of the energy-optimal motion lowered the energy consumption by 4.7% while keeping the precision constant and (ii) the more stringent time-constraints implemented in desirability functions lead to an operation mode with maximum precision and 51.7% less energy consumption than the current time-optimal motion.

Through the mutual compensation of force error and position error, the close chain internal force can be dynamically allocated in each joints, so that the robot joints force can be balanced during the operation, and the internal force in the close chain can be minimized during the operation process so as to ensure the operation reliability and safety. Finally, the validity and engineering practicability is verified by MATLAB simulation experiment and 220 kV living damper replacement and drainage plate bolt tightening operation experiment, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0142331218822717,2020-03-27 14:18:36,0142-3312,,,en,,Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are some jobs that require both human flexibility and robot power. Consequently, there is a demand to combine the high power of a robot arm with the dexterity of a human. In this work, a robot system called the power assistant robot (PAR) is proposed to satisfy this demand. The system can be applied not only in heavy industrial tasks, but also in various fields such as rehabilitation, the military, and security. This research focuses on applying a new type of actuator, called an electro-hydraulic system (EHA), in a power assistant robot. The EHA-PAR includes 5 degrees of freedom (1 passive joint and 4 active joints) and interacts with the user through a 4-dimensional intelligent joystick. By analyzing commands from a human, the human-robot interface distributes reference angles for all active joints. However, in some positions, robot operation is suffered from singularity phenomenon; thus it affect to the control quality. This paper proposes a strategy for this problem by combining the Grey predictor and the conventional kinematic solving method. It can be realized that the performance of the system is ameliorated by applying the proposed method.",security,singular point,singularity phenomenon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dynamics for human–robot co-manipulation is derived that includes human cognition, for example, weight perception. A novel admittance control scheme is derived using the weight perception–based dynamics. Human subjects lift a small-sized, lightweight object with the power assist robotic system. Human–robot interaction and system characteristics are analyzed. A comprehensive scheme is developed to evaluate the human–robot interaction and performance, and a constrained optimization algorithm is developed to determine the optimum human–robot interaction and performance. The results show that the inclusion of weight perception in the control helps achieve optimum human–robot interaction and performance for a set of hard constraints. In the second step, the same optimization algorithm and control scheme are used for lifting a heavy object with a multi-degree of freedom power assist robotic system. The results show that the human–robot interaction and performance for lifting the heavy object are not as good as that for lifting the lightweight object. Then, weight perception–based intelligent controls in the forms of model predictive control and vision-based variable admittance control are applied for lifting the heavy object. The results show that the intelligent controls enhance human–robot interaction and performance, help achieve optimum human–robot interaction and performance for a set of soft constraints, and produce similar human–robot interaction and performance as obtained for lifting the lightweight object. The human–robot interaction and performance for lifting the heavy object with power assist are treated as intuitive and natural because these are calibrated with those for lifting the lightweight object. The results also show that the variable admittance control outperforms the model predictive control. We also propose a method to adjust the variable admittance control for three degrees of freedom translational manipulation of heavy objects based on human intent recognition.

This paper presents a new power supply system for mobile robot platforms that has been developed in order to overcome these limitations. Its main goals are evaluating the feasibility of: 1) Fully integrating batteries and ultracapacitors, working simultaneously as energy-storing devices, with the aim of enabling a mobile robot platform to achieve a reasonable autonomy after a very reduced charging time and considerable autonomy when there are no charging time constraints; 2) Installing all the system in the mobile robot platform, avoiding the use of an external dedicated charging station; 3) Extracting almost all the energy previously stored in the ultracapacitors.

Both forward and inverse kinematic analyses of the robot are carried out with an assigned fixed global frame and subsequent local frames in the trunk body and joints of each leg. Coupled multi-body dynamic model of the robot is developed based on free-body diagram approach. Optimal feet forces and corresponding joint torques on all the legs are determined based on the minimization of the sum of the squares of joint torques, using quadratic programming (QP) method. An energy consumption model is developed to determine the minimum energy required for optimal values of feet forces. To ensure dynamically stable gaits, dynamic gait stability margin (DGSM) is determined from the angular momentum of the system about the supporting edges. Computer simulations have been carried out to test the effectiveness of the developed dynamic model with crab wave gaits on a banking surface. It is observed that when the swing leg touches the ground, impact forces (sudden shoot outs) are generated and their effects are also observed on the joints of the legs.

In order to achieve this we see a rapid increase in use of automatic production. Automation of industrial processes typically uses robot manipulators in operations such as drilling, welding, painting, laser cutting or assembly. In the pursuit of improved performance from industrial robot manipulators we see an increasing interest in development of optimal motion on different performance indexes such as velocity, accuracy or energy efficiency. This paper concerns energy efficient scenarios where even minor improvements in performance can lead to substantial impacts on both energy use and profit.

This master thesis includes development of a mathematical model for industrial robot manipulator IRB 1600, by ABB. This includes estimation of masses, centers of mass and inertias. Using a Nikon Metrology camera measurement system the dynamic friction of the robot is characterized, and repeated experiments indicate that friction compensation using this characterization improves performance of the robot in terms of accuracy by 25- 50% for joint 1 thru 3 for different scenarios.

Further, a scheme for development of optimal motion profiles is made, in terms of minimizing mechanical energy consumed by the robot. The motion profiles are made to follow a predefined path, and are derived through numerical optimization. Repeated experiments are performed using an inverse dynamics PD+ controller. By comparing the performance of the robot manipulator to trajectories developed using the standard motion planner (RobotStudio/Rapid), a decrease of about 7% in consumed energy is obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2357964,2020-03-27 14:25:07,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the analysis of the brachiation of gibbons and humans, the big damping nonholonomic constraints model is introduced. A control strategy which combines the energy pumping control with the big damping turn-back angle feedback control is proposed. The grasping motion was divided into several processes: the swing-up self-starting phase, the energy rising phase, the transition phase and the grasping phase. A self-starting controller is designed for swing-up motion from a downward stable position. In the energy rising phase, an energy pumping control law is deduced based on Lyapunov stability theory, and the singularity and convergence of the system are analyzed. The system energy is calculated periodically to determine if the robot gets enough energy for grasping, so that it could shift into the transition phase. A position–orientation control method is adopted to realize that the gripper grasps target bars in the desired position, orientation and speed. By means of ADAMS-MATLAB co-simulation, the bionic-ape robot achieves smooth swing-grasp motions under different heights and horizontal distances.

Mobile robots can operate untethered for a number of hours but eventually they will need to recharge their batteries in-order to continue to function. While computer processing and sensors have become cheaper and more powerful each year, battery development has progress very little. They are slow to re-charge, inefficient and lagging behind in the general progression of robotic development we see today. However, batteries are relatively cheap and when fully charged, can supply high power output necessary for operating heavy mobile robots. As there are no cheap alternatives to batteries, we need to find efficient ways to manage the power that batteries provide during their operational lifetime. This paper proposes the use of autonomic principles of self-adaption to address the behavioral changes a battery experiences as it gets older. In life, as we get older, we cannot perform tasks in the same way as we did in our youth; these tasks generally take longer to perform and require more of our energy to complete.

The method utilizes a nonlinear variable change that transforms the nonlinear optimization problem into a discrete second order cone programming that can be solved by convex optimization tools. The formulation of the multiobjective function has two components: the total energy and the traversal time that is weighted by a parameter named penalty coefficient. With the use of the penalty coefficient one can establish a trade-off between the optimization of the total energy and the traversal time. The relation between both objectives draws a Pareto Front in the criterion space parameterized by the penalty coefficient. The rationale of this paper is to assume that the Pareto curve is an exponential function, and to propose an algorithm to estimate its parameters. Using this exponential function it is possible to estimate the Knee Point that is an optimal solution that balances time and energy equally. This systematic approach might be understood as a self-tuning algorithm that estimate the penalty coefficient for the generation of optimal voltage signals.

This dissertation presents the development of a prototype industrial brachiating robot. The robot is mechanically simple and capable of dynamically negotiating obstacles by brachiating. This is an improvement over current robotic platforms, which employ slow, high power static schemes for obstacle negotiation.  Mathematical models of the robot were derived to understand the underlying dynamics of the system. These models were then used in the generation of optimal trajectories, using nonlinear optimisation techniques, for brachiating past line hardware.  A physical robot was designed and manufactured to validate the brachiation manoeuvre. The robot was designed following classic mechanical design principles, with emphasis on functional design and robustness.  System identification was used to capture the plant uncertainty and a feedback controller was designed to track the reference trajectory allowing for energy optimal brachiation swings.  Finally, the robot was tested, starting with sub-system testing and ending with testing of a brachiation manoeuvre proving the prospective viability of the robot in an industrial environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/20464,2020-03-27 14:32:32,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

human, and how one robot affects multiple human listeners. Much less knowledge is
available on how robots affect the human language and how this language change can
affect human attitudes and behaviours. This language effect is of particular interest for
when we get into a situation where a major part of the human population has robots, as
we are now experiencing with the ubiquity of smartphones. In this case, the questions
are: What happens if all robots were to use the same words? For example, when they all
use the same source as their dictionary. Will robots be able to affect the word choices of
the human population, and what are the implications of connotation-laden vocabulary?
Even more interesting, will this word choice affect the attitudes and behaviours of the
human population?

Through all those questions a central question for this thesis emerged: ""Are Robots
able to influence a group of people via the usage of language?"" To find out if this might
be possible, we developed three connected experiments. In the first, the effect of peer
pressure on humans created by robots is explored, focusing on how this peer pressure
affects the language of a person. To see if and how this influence of robots works, the
effect of the robots was compared against that of human actors. The results of the ex-
periment showed that the actors could indeed influence the participants as predicted,
however, no such influence could be shown by the robots. It was concluded that the
reason the robots did not affect the humans was that the participants did not feel that
they belonged to the robots group.

In the second experiment, a robot and human group setting was created. In this
experiment, the robot tried to influence the human language. Important here to mention
is that the experiment measured if the language of participants was affected by the robot
influence, even after the interaction and without any robot in the room. It was also mea-
sured if the word chosen by the robot had an influence on how a person would perceive
the discussed object. The outcome of the experiment was successful, and showed that
the group building worked and the robot was able to affect the human language, even
after the interaction was over. It further showed that robots were able to affect the hu-
mans attitude toward objects simply by using positive or negative connoted synonyms
for a particular object.

In the third and last experiment, the question was: Can many robots affect the
language of a whole human population? To answer this, different parameters were measured:
How many humans need robots so that the robots could manipulate the whole
human populations language? And does it matter which persons in the human population
will get a robot - whether it be a person who is very well connected or a person
who is poorly connected, for example? Since we are currently not in a time where a
huge number of people actually have robots, a simulation was created. The outcome of
the simulation was that on average only 11% of the human population needed robots to
affect the language of 95% of the human population.

Finally, to further deepen the knowledge on how simple language change can affect
human attitude and behaviour a literature review is added. This review focuses
particularly on persuasion via language, which includes effects like gender neutral versus
non-gender neutral language.

The conclusion of this thesis is that in certain situations, a group of robots is able
to affect the language, and in turn the behavioural responses, of the majority of the
human population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/13598,2020-03-27 14:33:08,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 A recent explosion in demand for sub sea robotics, for conducting tasks such as sub sea exploration and survey has left developers desiring to capture some of the novel mechanisms evolved by fish and cetaceans to increase the efficiency of speed and manoeuvrability of sub sea robots.
 
 Research has revealed that interactions with vortices and other unsteady fluid effects play a significant role in the efficiency of fish and cetaceans. However attempts to duplicate this with robotic fish have been limited by the difficulty of predicting or sensing such uncertain fluid effects. This study aims to develop a gait generation method for a robotic fish with a degree of passivity which could allow the body to dynamically interact with and potentially synchronise with vortices within the flow without the need to actually sense them.
 
 In this study this is achieved through the development of a novel energy based gait generation tactic, where the gait of the robotic fish is determined through regulation of the state energy rather than absolute state position.  Rather than treating fluid interactions as undesirable disturbances and  `fighting' them to maintain a rigid geometric defined gait, energy based control allows the disturbances to the system generated by vortices in the surrounding flow to contribute to the energy of the system and hence the dynamic motion.
 
 Three different energy controllers are presented within this thesis, a deadbeat energy controller equivalent to an analytically optimised model predictive controller, a $H_\infty$ disturbance rejecting controller with a novel gradient decent optimisation and finally a error feedback controller with a novel alternative error metric. The controllers were tested on a robotic fish simulation platform developed within this project.
 
 The simulation platform consisted of the solution of a series of ordinary differential equations for solid body dynamics coupled with a finite element incompressible fluid dynamic simulation of the surrounding flow. results demonstrated the effectiveness of the energy based control approach and illustrate the importance of choice of controller in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/handle/10026.1/1560,2020-03-27 14:34:32,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the power source of this device is on-board batteries the requirement for power consumption is relevant. In the course of the work the analysis of the device processes which shows that a significant current flows in the windings of the motors during the stabilizing system operation is carried out. This is the reason for the high power consumption. In addition this causes the motor windings heating which also has a negative effect on the system operation. Further in the work the factors influencing the power consumption of the device are researched taking into account the features of stabilization system implementation on a microcontroller and the features of the actuators and their control. Based on the result of this research a method of reducing ripple of the current in the motor windings is proposed and an example of its implementation in the control program of the device is given. It is shown that such system can be realized.

This method is realized by developing a semi-analytical pattern generation approach for a robot during each Single Support Phase (SSP). As yet, several control methods based on passive dynamic walking have been proposed by researchers to provide an efficient human-like biped walking robot. For most of these passive based controllers the main idea is to shape the robot’s energy level during each SSP to restore the mechanical energy which has been lost in the previous Impact Phases (IP); however, the EDRC method provides stable gaits for legged robots just by controlling the robot’s energy level during each IP. In this paper EDRC is applied to a Six-Link Three-Point Foot (6L3PF) model, to realize an active dynamic galloping gait on level ground. As the point-foot contact assumption for the 6L3PF imposes one degree of under-actuation in the ankle joint, it is not clear how to specify the forward kinematic defining the swing leg position and velocity as a function of actuated joint angles. So, a new strategy for solving the dynamic and kinematic equations of the robot is introduced for deriving suitable joint trajectories during each SSP.

Assim sendo, é de suma importância a poda de vegetação próxima à linhas energizadas. Visando-se aprimorar esse processo, pode-se empregar um robô teleoperado de poda, de forma que a poda possa ser realizada de maneira remota e segura. As câmeras instaladas no braço robótico permitem que o operador tenha visão da área de corte mesmo quando a visada direta do solo estiver obstruída. Um dos problemas de se visualizar a região de corte por meio de um monitor é a perda de noção de profundidade, o que pode dificultar a operação. Dessa forma, seria relevante uma técnica de visão computacional capaz de detectar as linhas de energia e seu posicionamento tridimensional (3D) a fim de auxiliar o operador. Revisando-se a literatura, avaliou-se que, no geral, os trabalhos já propostos para detecção de linhas em imagens operam em situações com fundo limpo, não urbanizado e com vista superior das linhas de energia. Assim sendo, nesse trabalho é proposta uma técnica para detecção de linhas energizadas em imagens de regiões urbanas e a obtenção de seu posicionamento 3D, fator ainda não explorado na literatura recente. Para se alcançar esse objetivo é proposta a utilização de câmeras de espectro visível posicionadas em paralelo. Assim, regiões com potencial para serem linhas de energia são selecionadas utilizando-se detecção de bordas seguidas por filtragens geométricas aplicando-se técnicas inspiradas em algoritmos de grafos e ajuste de pontos selecionados a uma curva. Após a seleção de regiões candidatas a linha de energia, o posicionamento 3D é obtido utilizando-se de visão estéreo. Para tal, a correspondência entre pontos visíveis em ambas as câmeras é encontrada e com triangulação o posicionamento 3D da linha de energia é recuperado. Com a informação 3D disponível falsos candidatos são reduzidos por um fator de aproximadamente sete vezes e finalmente as linhas são detectadas. Para avaliação do método foi criada uma base de dados contendo imagens estéreo obtidas de um cenário montado com dois postes, três linhas de energia e uma árvore entre essas, na qual foi possível atingir níveis de precisão de 98% ao término do processo de detecção, contando-se com 91% de taxa de verdadeiro positivos. As causas dos falsos negativos são evidenciadas para que trabalhos futuros possam encontrar alternativas às dificuldades apresentadas. O algoritmo aqui proposto fornece como saída um mapa de cor sobre as linhas de energia para identificação da profundidade em 2D e uma nuvem de pontos para visualização em 3D.

Robot localization using particles filter has been developed in recent years using wireless technologies with a significant success. BLE beacons measures are rather noisier than measures from similar wireless devices. In this work we make an initial model of BLE measures and their noise. The model is used to generate data to be processed by a particle filter designed for localization using only ultra-wide band (UWB) beacons ranges.

They need to understand their environment to perform their tasks and act upon local triggers. With the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), robots, with the help of powerful computing units, can now understand complex visual features, such as humans and objects. Since DNNs have high computation and power demands, to execute DNNs and achieve high performance, a robot requires state-of-the-art or domainspeciﬁc hardware. Although integrating such hardware in several scenarios is economically and logically sound (such as integrating GPUs in self-driving vehicles), for a handful of other scenarios several constraints limit this integration. For instance, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a constraint on their weight which limit their ability to carry high-capacity batteries. Thus, we need a good understating of DNNs power consumption on robots and UAVs. To understand the power consumption of robots and UAVs that execute DNNs beside their operation, we study a two-robot system with limited computing capabilities. We utilize a framework that enables collaboration among several low-power devices for enabling real-time execution of DNNs. Our execution platform includes two iRobots, each of which has been equipped with an additional Raspberry Pi 3, the power source of which is the iRobot’s battery. By executing an example DNN on interconnected Raspberry Pi 3s, while iRobots are operating, we quantify and study the power consumption effects of DNNs in our system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,"Kim, Hyesoon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boje[1], this thesis discusses the design and off-line testing of different types of Kalman filters to estimate the attitude, position and velocity of a robotic platform moving along a power line. The nature of this problem limits the use of magnetometers. Magnetic field interference from the steel pylons and steel cored conductors will affect the local magnetic field. Moreover, high frequency signals from on-board power electronic drives and induced magnetic fields due to ferromagnetic components of the robot along with aliasing, quantization effects and a low signal to noise ratio make notch filtering at 50 Hz impractical. Thus, a GPS/IMU filter solution, which uses the power line curvature and horizontal direction in measurements, to constrain the robot to the line was designed. Different types of filters were implemented; The Extended Kalman filter (EKF), the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the Error State Kalman filter (ErKF). Measurements were recorded and the filters were tested offline. While all the filters tracked properly, it was found that the EKF was better in computational speed completing an iteration in 87 µs, the ErKF was second best with an average time of 120 µs for one iteration and the UKF was last with an average time of 1040 µs for one iteration. Errors between the true state and estimated state for the simulation were quantified using root mean square values (RMS). The RMS values were almost the same for the EKF and ErKF with the error for the x position at 0.81 m and z position at 0.038 m. The UKF produced RMS errors of 0.79 m for x position and 0.11 m for z position. It can be seen that the UKF is slightly better for the x position but is much worse for the z position. Overall, the GPS measurement RMS values used were 4 m and 20 m for the horizontal and vertical positions respectively. Thus, the filters brought a big improvement. However, the recommended filter is the EKF as is produced comparable or better results as compared to other filters and expends the least computational effort. A state estimator was also developed for a J.Patel’s PLIR project [2], where a brachiating version of a power line robot was modeled. The brachiation mechanism was approximated to a double pendulum and kinematics based Kalman filter was designed. Simulations of EKF and UKF were made. The EKF is still recommended as its estimates are closer to the true values and its computation time is about five times faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/29474,2020-03-27 14:39:20,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper takes MD1200-YJ palletizing robot as the research object and studies the problem of low energy consumption optimization of joint driving system from the perspective of trajectory optimization. Firstly, a multifactor dynamic model of palletizing robot is established based on the conventional inverse rigid body dynamic model of the robot, the Stribeck friction model and the spring balance torque model. And then based on joint torque, friction torque, motion parameter, and joule’s law, the useful work model, thermal loss model of joint motor, friction energy consumption model of joint system, and total energy consumption model of palletizing robot are established, and through simulation and experiment, the correctness of the multifactor dynamic model and energy consumption model is verified. Secondly, based on the Fourier series approximation method to construct the joint trajectory expression, the minimum total energy consumption as the optimization objective, with coefficients of Fourier series as optimization variables, the motion parameters of initial and final position, and running time constant as constraint conditions, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Finally, through the simulation analysis the optimized Fourier series motion law and the 3-4-5 polynomial motion law are comprehensively evaluated to verify the effectiveness of the optimization method.

Design/methodology/approach Through the layering of aerial-online-ground robot three-dimensional control architecture, the robot joint motion dynamic model has been built, and the motion control model of the N-degrees of freedom robot system has also been obtained. On this basis, the state space expression of joint motion control under disturbance and uncertainty has been also derived, and the manipulator sliding mode variable structure trajectory tracking control model has also been established. The influence of the perturbation control parameters on the robot motion control can be compensated by the back propagation neural network learning, the stability of the controller has been analyzed by using Lyapunov theory. Findings The robot has been tested on a analog line in the lab, the effectiveness of sliding mode variable structure control is verified by trajectory tracking simulation experiments of different typical signals with different methods. The field operation experiment further verifies the engineering practicability of the control method. At the same time, the control method has the remarkable characteristics of sound versatility, strong adaptability and easy expansion. Originality/value Three-dimensional control architecture of underground-online-aerial robots has been proposed for industrial field applications in the ubiquitous power internet of things environment (UPIOT). Starting from the robot joint motion, the dynamic equation of the robot joint motion and the state space expression of the robot control system have been established. Based on this, a robot closed-loop trajectory tracking control system has been designed. A robust trajectory tracking motion control method for robots based on sliding mode variable structure theory has been proposed, and a sliding mode control model for the robot has been constructed. The uncertain parameters in the control model have been compensated by the neural network in real-time, and the sliding mode robust control law of the robot manipulator has been solved and obtained. A suitable Lyapunov function has been selected to prove the stability of the system. This method enhances the expansibility of the robot control system and shortens the development cycle of the controller. The trajectory tracking simulation experiment of the robot manipulator proves that the sliding mode variable structure control can effectively restrain the influence of disturbance and uncertainty on the robot motion stability, and meet the design requirements of the control system with fast response, high tracking accuracy and sound stability.

We solve this optimal control problem using an approach based on the Euler–Lagrange necessary condition in integral form in which time is discretized and admissible variations for each variable are approximated using a linear combination of piecewise-continuous basis functions of time. Our method consists in a numerical resolution of an unconstrained reformulation of the optimal control problem in which the dynamic equation is regarded as a constraint. Then, we use a damped Newton methodology to solve the resulting nonlinear system of difference equations. The required initial guess of the solution is obtained using a trigonometric polynomial interpolation. The use of the Euler–Lagrange necessary condition in integral form avoids the numerical intricacy caused by the presence of corner of the extremals. In this way a general method for the solution of optimal control problems is obtained in which constraints on the state can be easily introduced.

While the designer tries to increase the power of the motors to give the robot better payload capacity, by doing so, it also makes the robot itself heavier and then the improvement in payload capacity is lost in lifting the robot itself. Many approaches to improve payload capacity consist in using an existing commercial electric motor and modifying it by adding external accessories to avoid non-safe motor internal heat. They usually use a mechanic reduction to increase payload capacity, but they lose maximum speed at the same time. Currently, there are no proper solutions for a motor in a humanoid robot application that manages to lift very heavy objects at high speed and that at the same time the motors are small and lightweight. In order to obtained more power from the robot joint actuator, in this paper we propose and compared a new thermal channel and thermal sealed jacket design for a permanent magnet electric motor to solve this problem. The design takes advantage of the fractional-slot concentrated-winding motor configuration and its fill factor to force liquid and air directly to the winding separately, in order to examine their head extradition to increase its performance in a specify scenario. The propose design shows an improvement in relation to the head extraction of the sealed jacket design with respect to the thermal channels when forcing liquid through them. Both designs are simulated assuming an extreme scenario where the winding reaches 100 °C for validation purposes.

Omnidirectional autonomous mobile robots without any nonholonomic constraints can reach the same goal pose from the same start pose via too many feasible trajectories, each consuming different amounts of energy. It is both economically beneficial and academically interesting to optimize the omnidirectional trajectories of holonomic Mecanum autonomous mobile robots for energy minimization. The aim of this PhD research was to first develop a heavy-duty omnidirectional Mecanum mobile robot that can perform fully functional autonomous navigation for research purposes, and then to realize energy-efficient autonomous navigation on the designed robot via both online and offline optimal motion planning research studies. A heavy-duty omnidirectional Mecanum robot platform was designed and developed from the beginning. The robotic control system architecture that allows the robot to perform autonomous navigation was realized by fusing an industrial automation control system and open-source autonomous navigation technologies. Then an experimentally validated novel energy consumption model of the four-wheel omnidirectional Mecanum mobile robot was proposed based on a comprehensive understanding of the kinematics, dynamics and energy flow of the robot. In order to realize energy-efficient autonomous navigation, both online and offline optimal planners were presented in this research. The proposed online planner extended the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) by means of a new energy-optimal omnidirectional velocity search technique for the purposes of optimizing motional power consumption and reducing energy consumption for autonomous navigation. The offline planner proposed a method of trajectory generation that interpolates the task-space trajectory of the omnidirectional robot in polynomial spline functions and then searches for the energy-optimal trajectories using genetic algorithms. Both proposed online and offline planning methods were experimentally validated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/37650,2020-03-27 14:45:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the root causes of the reduced heaviness as well as the factors affecting the heaviness are still unknown. The knowledge on the root causes and factors could be used to modulate the interactions between the human user and the robot when lifting objects with it. This paper investigated the reasons and factors behind the reduced heaviness of objects lifted with a power assist system. We hypothesized that weight perception due to inertia might be different from that due to gravity when lifting an object with a power assist system because the actual weight and the perceived weight were different. Subjects lifted objects manually and with power-assist separately. We compared load forces and motion features for the manually lifted objects to that for the power-assisted objects and found that the load force and its rate, velocity and acceleration for the power-assisted objects were lower than that for the manually lifted objects. We noticed that there were time delays in force sensing, position sensing, servomotor etc. for the power-assisted objects, but not for the manually lifted objects. We assumed that the delays were responsible for the reduced heaviness of objects lifted with power-assist. Finally, we proposed to use the findings to develop human-friendly power assist devices for manipulating heavy objects in industries that would help improve/modulate interactions between users and robots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, having locally variable compliant parts with independent dynamics under the same body may be insufficient for achieving adaptability in diverse environments.

Then the posture balance controller against the impact force disturbance is designed. Stability of the foot rotation phase space is analyzed for our controller and other two existing controllers. Also, the situation of no balance controller is analyzed as a presentation of the system's passive characteristic. Then area of the stable region is compared between these three controllers. Simulations under frontal impact disturbances are also conducted. The results demonstrate that, our controller is able to resist stronger impact disturbance and make the robot recover its balance in a shorter time.

The main issues are related to mobility and autonomy. In mobility, biped robots have evolved greatly, nevertheless they are still far from what a human can do in the work-site. Similarly, autonomy of biped platforms has been tackled on several different grounds, but its core problem still remains, and it is associated to energy issues. Because of these energy issues, lately the main attention has been redirected to the long term autonomy of the biped robotics platforms. For that, much effort has been made to develop new more energy-efficient biped robots.

The GIMBiped project in Aalto University was established to tackle the previous issues in energy efficiency and mobility, through the study and implementation of dynamic and energy-efficient bipedal robotic waking. This thesis falls into the first studies needed to achieve the previous goal using the GIMBiped testbed, starting with a detailed analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of the target system, using a modeling and simulation tools. This work also presents an assessment of different control techniques based on Limit Cycle walking, carried out on a two-dimensional kneed bipedal simulator.

Furthermore, a numerical continuation analysis of the mechanical parameters of the first GIMBiped prototype was performed, using the same approximated planar kneed biped model. This study is done to analyze the effect that such variations in the mechanical design parameters produce in the stability and energy-efficiency of the system.Finally, experiments were performed in the GIMBiped testbed. These experiments show the results of a hybrid control technique proposed by the author, which combines traditional ZMP-based walking approach with a Limit Cycle trajectory-following control. Furthermore the results of a pure ZMP-based type of control are also presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi:443/handle/123456789/11849,2020-03-27 14:50:12,978-952-60-5488-9,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, power line inspection robots are designed to replace the tedious and dangerous manual inspection using linemen or helicopters. However, most of the existing inspection robots are heavy, which make them slow and prone to external wind disturbance. This paper developed a lightweight dual-arm robot and investigates its robustness to wind disturbance on a lab-scale power line structure. The dynamic equations of the robot are derived using the Lagrangian equation for appropriate motor selection. Also, the components of the robot are designed to ensure low drag coefficient to wind flow, and the mechanism of the wind force on the robot-line coupled system is presented. To study the real-time impact of the wind, a wind speed of 4.5 m/s representing one of the windiest cities in China is considered as a case study. The experimental results for different wind directions, namely, 0°, 45°, and 90°, show that the maximum vibration is 8% higher than the normal vibration of the system in a controlled environment without wind. The results demonstrate that there is little influence of the wind on the system; hence, the robot has been successfully designed and can be applied for power line inspection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2019/2139462/,2020-03-27 14:50:44,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the moveable feature of transmitting coil and receiving coil, misalignment issue lead to extra power loss, decrease in efficiency, increase in control complexity, and unwanted performance degradation of the whole system. Moreover, it happened frequently than those traditional planar coils systems. The motivation for this paper is trying to have a deep understanding of quantitative relationship between ball-shaped coils mutual inductance and misalignment. Based upon that, engineers would know more detail of the coils position and mutual inductance. So, optimized design might be achieved. On considering that, this paper presents a WPT system with a ball-shaped coil for robot joints. A mutual inductance calculation based on filament method aimed at ball-shaped coil is proposed. Based on these, nine different ball-shaped coil solutions are calculated. Then, model with a minimized change rate of mutual inductance against the angular misalignment is chosen as the optimized design. Circuit analysis of the WPT system with the series–series resonant topology is conducted to choose a proper working frequency and load. Finally, an experimental platform is established.

It is crucial to detect and diagnose a possible problem on the lines before that occurs. In general, maintenance, repair and error detection operations of the electrical transmission lines are performed by humans periodically. However, these difficult tasks contain high-risks in terms of occupational health and safety. Moreover, it is not possible to continuously inspect these lines which extend over long distances by maintenance and repair personnel. For all these reasons, it is very convenient to use robotic systems for inspection on power transmission lines. By evaluating the data which are provided from sensors and cameras of robotic systems, it would be possible to take precautions before an error occurs. Robotic systems that can move continuously along the line would be able to gather continuous and uninterrupted information. Thus, potential problems can be detected and identified in advance. In this study, a single wheel drive low-cost mobile robot is designed and controlled which can work and move on the electrical transmission lines. Because of the modular structure of the designed robot, different types of sensors can be integrated into the robot, easily.

Different from the traditional methods of storing potentially recyclable energy using accumulators, the energy-saving principle of HPCA is to utilize the pressure-transition characteristics of the asymmetric hydraulic cylinder with control of the symmetrical valve. The accumulator can store and release oil during the switching of the transition point in each gait cycle of the robot, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the actuator.

One of the most intriguing issues in manufacturing stage of production line is to minimize significantly high percentage of energy consumed by these robot manipulators. The energy optimal control of robotic manipulators is a complex problem, as it requires a deep understanding of the robot's kinematics and dynamic behaviors. This paper propose a novel method of energy efficient path planning of an industrial robot arm in a workspace with multiple obstacles using differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The path-planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem with an aim to determine the shortest and energy optimal path of the robot arm from its given initial position to the pre-defined goal location, without hitting obstacles. Application of such evolutionary algorithms in trajectory planning is advantageous because the exact solution to the path-planning problem is not always available beforehand and must be determined dynamically. Experiments undertaken reveal that the DE-based path-planning algorithm outperforms its contenders in a significant manner.",robot kinematics behavior,robotic manipulators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two control strategies, computed force/torque and adaptive compensators, are applied to minimize uncertainties accompanied by the robot’s movements. The two compensators are then compared by simulating applied external disturbances, such as mobile base tipping motion and load mass changes on the robot end-effector.

As energy supply and demand have become global issues, energy saving in  industrial robots has become urgent.  In general industrial pick-and-place robots, servomotors periodically  repeat acceleration and deceleration, consequently lose much energy in motion.  We propose a mechanism using an in-frame parallel spring for the pick-and-place  robot.  During motion, spring blades deform and store energy, then release it as  energy of motion, enabling the mechanism to recycle energy that have been lost  in conventional mechanisms.  In this paper, a 1 DOF proof-of-concept prototype and preliminary feasibility  tests are described.  In this study, we applied in-frame parallel springs to a mechanism for  pick-and-place robot.  The parallel springs are fabricated from spring steel SK85M (Young’s modulus:  210 GPa) with 252 mm long, 50 mm wide and 0.3 mm thick.  The results suggest that the prototype can achieve a repeated motion with the  range of ±145.7 mm in 2.56 Hz by 1.17 W, greatly reduced from that of the  the traditional mechanisms.  In addition, it is desired to stop the robot immediately in regular motion if  anomalies occurred in industrial applications.

Driver assistance systems show the potential to increase the fuel economy and optimize the range of standard and electric vehicles. Eco-driving focused systems optimize velocity trajectories with respect to energy consumption and suggest these optimized speeds to drivers with the goal of reducing overall energy consumption. Because the systems have no direct control over vehicle behavior, the driver’s inclination to follow the commands is important to their effectiveness. This can be improved by personalizing the velocity commands to suit an individual’s driving behavior, requiring a model capable of accurately predicting styles of individual drivers. Two methods for identifying, modeling, and predicting driver behavior using driving data time-series are investigated. The first, pattern recognition-based approach breaks down the data into homogeneous segments using heuristic, dynamic programming, and bottom-up methods. Segments are grouped based on acceleration behavior and used, in conjunction with function-fit regression and system identification methods, to construct models describing driving behavior. Contrary to the first approach, the second, machine learning based method constructs a model using an entire time-series by analyzing relationships between multiple variables. Finally, each method is evaluated in it’s ability to accurately predict driver acceleration and velocity behavior. Part 2
Enforcing multiple, sometimes conflicting control objectives is a challenge present in modern advanced driver assistance systems. Drivers are capable of activating multiple modules simultaneously where safety must be guaranteed at all times. Examples includes adaptive speed regulation, where the vehicle must achieve a desired speed while maintaining a safe distance to any preceding vehicle, and lane keeping, where a vehicle is kept safely within the bounds of a lane. Provably safe algorithms for both adaptive speed regulation and lane keeping are introduced and used to run experiments on two robotic testbeds. The underlying algorithms are based on control Lyapunov functions for performance, a control barrier functions for safety, and a real-time quadratic program for mediating the conflicting demands between the two. The Robotarium, a robotic testbed that allows students, as well as researchers less experienced with hardware, to experiment with advanced control concepts in a safe and standardized environment, is compared with a more expensive OptiTrack based Khepera robot testbed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/59310,2020-03-27 15:09:29,,,,en_US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, an intelligent management of limited number of docking points for a large number of robots is required. This paper proposes a multi-robot path planning scheme which considers the available power in the robots along with other factors like task priority, and can manage a limited number of docking points for a large number of robots.

In fact, Exoskeleton robotic
technology can be used to provide assistance for age society to perform activities of daily
living (ADL) without depending on others.
Upper limb exoskeleton robots are much suitable to perform ADL. Typically, upper limb
exoskeleton robot consists of number of joints and links which are corresponding to joints
and limbs of human upper limb. Further, exoskeleton robots differ from other conventional
robots due to present of close interaction with wearer. In general, two types of interaction
can be seen in exoskeleton robots: physical human robot interaction (pHRI) and cognitive
human robot interaction (cHRI).Strengthening features of cHRI can be seen on recent
developments of upper limb exoskeleton robots. However, there exists a vacuum to identify
aspects of pHRI relating to performance of exoskeleton robots.
The research work of this thesis is focused to design an upper limb exoskeleton robot for
motion assist taking effect of kinematic redundancy. The proposed exoskeleton robot (6-
REXOS) has four active degree of freedom (DOF) and two passive DOF in its kinematic
chain. Two passive DOF are provided to 6-REXOS by means of flexible bellow coupling
and those are positioned at wrist and elbow joint of the 6-REXOS to keep their axes parallel
to each other. This configuration enhances kinematic redundancy in 6-REXOS. The effect of
redundancy is verified with respect to dexterity measures, such as manipulability index,
minimum singular value, and condition number. Further, manipulation of end-effector of 6-
REXOS due to kinematic redundancy in operational space is presented base on
manipulability ellipsoids.
4DOF kinematic model for human lower arm is proposed in thesis. Manipulability measure
of human kinematic model is used to benchmark the performance of 6-REXOS. Different
measures are taken into account in design of 6-REXOS to ensure smooth pHRI. Passive
compliance of bellow coupling in order to reduce kinematic discrepancy as well as improve
the manipulation of 6-REXOS is highlighted in this thesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dl.lib.mrt.ac.lk/handle/123/11300,2020-03-27 15:11:03,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel Globally Asynchronous-Locally Synchronous (GALS) architecture using hybrid parallel-pipelined design is being used for the implementation. FPGA offers highly parallel hardware architectures that are not possible on conventional high end processors or other embedded controllers. Specifically, a parallel architecture for collision avoidance is proposed that portrays the advantages of FPGA implementation over the sequential implementation for same processor or clock speed with the objective of parallelizing the computation. The proposed two-tier GALS architecture based system with hybrid parallel-pipelined architectural design when realized on FPGA shows its efficiency in terms of power, resources and response time in comparison with a conventional GALS design. Due to the asynchronous design, a good amount of logic in the hardware becomes combinational logic and hence a significant reduction in the total resource utilization and power-delay product (PDP) in the proposed architecture is observed.

The raise in indoor air pollution had led to severe concerns to elderly people, infants and asthmatic patients even if they stay back at home. Commonly static room air purifiers are used, but a movable air purifier which can sense the location of higher concentration of air pollution and move the system accordingly can improve the overall efficiency of the air purifier. This type of air purifier needs electricity to run. This paper proposes a self-power generating air purifier robot, which is capable of electricity generation, sensing air quality and air purifying by moving it to desired location. Hence this robot can be utilized both by urban and rural area people.

The proposed approach is based on a four-way video image information output from a dual-operation manipulator. Design/methodology/approach First, based on the structural characteristics of the drainage line, an autonomous search method for the drainage plate bolt and a mapping relationship between the autonomous search control parameters and the relative posture of the operation manipulator-drainage line are proposed. The posture control parameters of the dual manipulators can then be obtained, and a two-dimensional fuzzy controller is designed with the posture offset distance and the posture offset angle as its input signals. This enables the localization control of the bolt and nut alignment to be realized through a visual process. Findings The proposed fuzzy control algorithm is used for bolt location control, and its performance is compared with that of the conventional approach. The simulation results indicate that the fuzzy control algorithm greatly improves the localization accuracy and operational efficiency of live operation robots. Originality/value Field operation experiments on actual transmission lines verify that the fuzzy control-based visual localization control of the robot manipulator has great engineering practicality.

An energy consumption model is developed for statically stable wave gaits in order to minimize dissipating energy for optimal feet forces distributions. The effects of gait parameters, namely angular velocity, angular stroke and duty factors are studied on energy consumption, as the six-legged robot walks along a circular path of constant radius with wave gait. The variations of average power consumption and energy consumption per unit weight per unit traveled length with the angular velocity and angular stroke are compared for the turning gaits of a robot with four different duty factors. Computer simulations show that wave gait with a low duty factor is more energy-efficient compared to that with a high duty factor at the highest possible angular velocity.

In numerical simulations, vibrations due to flexibility of the timing belts are investigated for the angular displacements, speeds, accelerations of arms, and the horizontal and vertical displacements of the robot. In comparisons of numerical simulations and experimental results, it is demonstrated that identification results of the dynamic model present well matching with the system. Finally, the VSC tracking control based on the minimum IAEE trajectory is realized and its robustness and energy-saving performance is demonstrated simultaneously. The proposed methodology to design the minimum IAEE trajectory can also be applied to any other mechatronic system driven by a PMSM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40435-018-0470-7,2020-03-27 15:16:08,2195-2698,,,en,,Int.

This paper establishes 3D model of the hexapod robot equipped with the collinear driver leg mechanism and the ordinary distributed leg mechanism, and imports them into the ADAMS for dynamic simulation. The collinear driver mechanism is used as a design scheme, and the distributed driver is used as a comparison scheme in order to verify whether the collinear driver mechanism is superior to the existing distributed driver mechanism in terms of energy consumption and dynamic parameters. From the comparison of the simulation results, it is found that the energy consumption of the collinear driver mechanism is significantly smaller than that of the distributed driver mechanism, which proves that it is a new design with low energy consumption in the closed chain leg mechanism.

This is both to make robots cost effective for businesses and environmentally friendly.

During the course of this thesis a method for planning an energy efficient velocity profile for an ABB IRB 1600 robot has been developed. This method does not only look at the assignment of velocity and acceleration along a path, but also the gain of energy efficiency that optimizing the position and orientation of a manipulation task have.

The result of this method shows that the optimal position and orientation gives a minimization of the movement of the second joint, and that at this optimal position the gain in energy efficiency of the optimal orientation is 161.1% from the horizontal plane. The optimal trajectory also have a 16.3% smaller energy consumption than a trajectory made by ABBs own motion planner in the optimal plane. Thus, the work done in this thesis optimize energy in two ways. 

Experiments were also performed to find the maximum and minimum torque for the first three joints of the robot. This was supposed to be used when constraining acceleration and jerk. These constraints were however excluded from the optimization scheme as the energy efficient trajectories obtained were nowhere close to the torque bounds. These experimental results are however greatly of interest when looking at time-optimal trajectories, and can be reused for this purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2441145,2020-03-27 15:17:30,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A monopod is emulated using a concave balancing mechanism, referred to as the body, mounted on an inverted pendulum, referred to as the leg, via a hip joint. The body curvature, represented by ϕ, can be altered and is elected as the design parameter of interest as it is observed that at an optimal body span angle, ϕopt, certain interesting phenomena transpire: The linearized system is transformed from nonminimum to minimum phase (MP), the conditions for feedback linearization of the nonlinear model satisfied, and minimal mechanical power required for stability of the simulated model is observed. A nonlinear gray-box system identification routine is developed and implemented within MATLAB, to estimate certain immeasurable parameters that arise within the original system dynamics. To estimate the optimal angle ϕopt, another immeasurable parameter, the identification routine is further employed for various values of ϕ. A locus of the transfer function zeros is then used to interpolate the value of ϕ at which the system achieves MP behavior. At this configuration, the magnitude of the transfer function zeros become much larger in comparison with that of the largest pole and, therefore, has a negligible contribution to the phase characteristics of the system. After the experimental identification of ϕopt, a Linear Quadratic Regulator with integral action is design and implemented to achieve the control objectives, with the design parameters set as close as physically realizable to the optimal setting. A nonlinear controller based on Feedback Linearization is also designed and implemented to take advantage of one benefit of this proposed design. The performance of the nonlinear controller is also compared against that of the LQ Regulator. Analysis and documentation of the power savings from the proposed design, in relation to existing prototypes, is a subject of further works. Furthermore, the performance of the developed controllers can be further improved via careful tuning to meet more stringent control objectives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-1469-8_14,2020-03-27 15:17:50,978-1-4614-1469-8,,,en,,,"Dai, Liming","Jazar, Reza N.",,"New York, NY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimization routine results the specification of a representative dynamic robot model.

A non-linear optimization using sequential quadratic solver is used to minimize a cost function based on the execution time or the energy consumption.

Robotics platforms should be, as much as possible, autonomous and self-sufficient, also from the energetic point of view. To this aim, up to now, the best compromise appears to be the use of micro solar power systems with rechargeable batteries. The use of this strategy for supplying systems with limited size and mass, but nevertheless high power requirements, such as a mobile robot, has been first studied. The system taken as test-bed in the experiment is a bio-inspired mobile robot, called TriBot. 
First of all, a preliminary analysis of the feasibility of a photovoltaic system with batteries to supply this mobile robot has been done, considering the different solutions to place the PV cells on the robot structure, the different photovoltaic technologies and the power consumption of the robot, the conclusion is that, using the photovoltaic system here proposed, it is possible to increase the autonomy of the robot.
Since in the PV system here analyzed few solar cells can be employed, a very efficient charging system is an essential requisite. To this aim, a novel photovoltaic charge regulator, which uses the Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage MPPT method, is proposed. 
A typical stand-alone photovoltaic system includes a solar array, batteries, regulator and load. In order to model the whole system and to evaluate its performance, a Simulink model in Matlab environment has been developed. In the simulator, measured values of the radiation and the temperature have been used, Anyhow, it will be possible also to use predicted values of radiation and temperature.  
In this work, data given us by a weather forecast provider have been used. First of all the accuracy of these predicted data have been determined. Then, a method to classify each minute of a day as variable, cloudy, slightly cloudy or clear has been implemented. Using a neural network, a correlation between the classification of a specific day and the error done has been found. The knowledge of the available energy, in fact, should allow to implement power saving strategies, optimizing the activities of the robot. 
Forecast and measured solar radiation are relative to the horizontal plane. However, the PV panel exposition is not assumed to be a control variable due to the fact that the robot can change its posture operating on uneven terrains. For these reasons, models are required to estimate the solar radiation on the plane of the PV array starting from the radiation on the horizontal plane. To this aim, Perez and Klucher models have been developed, these models require information at the same time on the global and the direct or diffuse radiation on the horizontal surface. Moreover, a neural network that allows to evaluate the global solar radiation on the tilted surface directly from the global solar radiation measured on the horizontal plane, without the need to slit it into the direct and diffuse components, has been developed.
Once that the solar radiation, measured or forecast, at any inclination and orientation are estimated; the power consumption of the robot and the efficiency of the charge regulator are known, all these information can be used in the Simulink model that, therefore, can become a very helpful tool to estimate the power production of the photovoltaic system and therefore the increase of the autonomy of the embedded systems used as load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://archivia.unict.it:8080/handle/10761/1102,2020-03-27 15:18:56,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
