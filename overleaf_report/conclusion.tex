\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
This literature study has given an insightful overview of the state-of-the-art in scientific literature on analyzing and improving 
energy efficiency in robotics software and identified trade-offs typically associated with such improvements.
Despite the already gained improvements in CO2 emmissions and energy consumption over the past years, as mentioned in section \ref{sec:intro}, 
Fysikopoulos et al. \cite{fysikopoulos2012automotive_energy_consumption} assert that 20\% to 40\% unnecessary use of energy may 
still be found in industrial firms.

The motivation for the expansion of research into the energy impact of robotic software \textit{itself} has been given in section \ref{sec:discussion}
and is a significant contribution of this literature study.
