# Energy Efficiency in Robotics Software: A Systematic Literature Review â€“ Replication package

This repository contains the replication package and dataset of the systematic literature review on energy efficiency in robotics software. 
Using this repository, one can:

- Replicating the steps to filter the potentially relevant studies (683) to the considered studies (610).
- Replicating the snowballing steps with each iteration.
- Replicating the statistical analysis

This study has been designed, performed, and reported by the following researchers:

- [Stan Swanborn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stan-swanborn-0470b4a9/) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
- [Ivano Malavolta](https://www.ivanomalavolta.com) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)

### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

- The statistical analysis is located in the `data_statistics` folder.
- The datasets (potentially relevant, considered sets and the snowballing sets) and the automated filter steps are located in the `jupyter_notebook` folder.
